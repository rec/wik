---+ Re-parenting a topic

The breadcrumb displayed with a particular TWiki topic is constructed with a topic's *parent*. The footer of each page has a link called ==[More topic actions]==.  Within this page there is a section that will allow you to set a new parent for the page.

To re-parent a page:

   1 Enter name of new parent topic, or pick from a list
   1 Click on the ==[Set new parent]== button

You will notice that the breadcrumb will now reflect the new parent.
