---++ Introduction

This contrib does not add any features to TWiki.  Its purpose is to
convert Perl's CGI module from being an external dependency to a
component of TWiki.

---++ Detailed Documentation

This is the stub module of CgiContrib.  Its only purpose is to expose
the version number of CGI under its expected package name, so that the
TWiki dependency checking mechanism will find it.

 

---++ Settings

   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = CGI version 4.13 from CPAN:CGI

---++ Installation Instructions

This contrib ships with TWiki (versions 6.0.2 or newer).  You should
only consider installing it yourself if 1) you experience problems
with CGI in your installation, and 2) installing or upgrading this is
recommended by the TWiki community as a fix for your problems.

You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this contrib package. These instructions are for the administrator who installs the package on the server where TWiki is running.

This contrib is a fix to numerous problems with =CGI.pm= on platforms
which do not, or no longer, ship this module together with the Perl
core:
   * Perl version 5.22 does no longer contain the =CGI= modules
   * Red Hat Linux and its derivatives has not shipped the =CGI=
     distribution with its Perl versions for years.

If you have problems installing TWiki on one of these platforms
because of problems with CGI similar to TWiki:Support.SID-01980 or
TWiki:Support.SID-02001, installing this contrib on top of TWiki
should fix it.

%I% With the next TWiki release _after_ 6.0.1, this contrib will be
part of the TWiki core (see TWiki:Codev.AddCGIpmToTWikiCore) and
doesn't need to be installed.
