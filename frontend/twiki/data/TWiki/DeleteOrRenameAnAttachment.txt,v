---++ FAQ:

How do I delete or rename a file attachment?

---++ Answer:

You can move and delete attachments directly from your browser. Moving lets you transfer an attachment from one topic to another. The soft delete moves an attachment to the special ==TrashAttachment== topic in the ==Trash== web, where it's hidden but can be "undeleted" with system administrator access. Please note that you cannot rename an attachment in the current TWiki release.

Click on ==[action]== on the file in the FileAttachment table, then in the *Update attachment* screen choose ==[Move attachment]==, and make your changes to that screen.

__NOTE:__ The configuration of your site and your own access permissions determine whether you can access these functions.

Note for system administrators: To remove an attachment permanently move it to the Trash.<nop>TrashAttachment topic, then with file-level access, delete the file attachment and its =,v= repository file manually from =twiki/pub/Trash/TrashAttachment=.
