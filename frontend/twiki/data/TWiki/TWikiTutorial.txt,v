---+ 20-Minute TWiki Tutorial

This step-by-step, hands-on tutorial gets you up to speed with all the TWikiSite basics, in _mere minutes_...

%TOC%

---++ 1. Get set...

Open two browser windows, so that you can follow these steps in one window, while trying things out in the other.

---++ 2. Take a quick tour...

A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one usually represents one workspace for collaboration. You can navigate the webs from the Home menu of each web page.
   * Each web has hyperlinked topics, displayed as pages in your browser. 
   * The home page in each web is the %HOMETOPIC% topic.
   * To browse a TWiki web, just click on any highlighted link. These links are called WikiWords and comprise two or more words with initial capitals, run together. 
   * Follow the WikiWord link and learn what it is.
   * If you know the name of a topic, you can jump directly to it by typing its name into the JumpBox on the top of the page. Type =%NOTIFYTOPIC%= to jump to the %NOTIFYTOPIC% topic. __Hint:__ Do not confuse the Jump box with search.
   * You can search each TWiki web. Enter a search string in the %HOMETOPIC% topic or the WebSearch topic accessible from the =Search= link in the Web menu. TWiki searches for an exact match; optionally, you can also use RegularExpressions.

---++ 3. Create an account...

To edit topics or participate in restricted webs, you need to have a TWiki account.
   * Go to the TWikiRegistration page to create your TWiki account. Fill in a couple of lines and you're set!

---++ 4. Check out TWiki users &amp; groups...

   * Go to the %USERSWEB%.UserList topic; it has a list of all users of TWiki. Your name will be in this list after you register.
   * Go to the %USERSWEB%.TWikiGroups topic in the %USERSWEB% web; it has a list of groups which can be used to define fine grained TWikiAccessControl in TWiki.

---++ 5. Learn the page controls...

The buttons at the top and the color-coded control strip at the bottom of the page have a collection of action links. Different skins show different links, but most will have some or all of:
   * ==Edit== - add to or edit the topic (discussed later)
   * ==Raw Edit== - edit the topic using WikiSyntax (discussed later)
   * ==Raw View== - show the source text without editing the topic
   * ==Attach== - attach files to a topic (discussed later)
   * ==Backlinks== - find out what other topics link to this topic (reverse link)
   * ==Print version== - goes to a stripped down version of the page, good for printing
   * ==History== - topics are under revision control - =History= shows you the complete change history of the topic, for example, who changed what and when
   * ==r3 &gt; r2 &gt; r1== - view a previous version of the topic or the difference between two versions
   * ==More topic actions== - additional controls, such as rename/move, version control, and setting the topic's parent.

---++ 6. Create a topic, modify a topic, and link to a topic...

Go to the [[Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%][Sandbox]]. This is the sandbox web, where you can create topics and add content to try it all out at will.
   * To create your own test topic, click on =Create !TestTopic###=, or invent a WikiWord and click on ==Create by Name==. You are now in edit mode where you can add content to the new topic. Save the topic and voil&agrave;, you just created your first TWiki page!
   * Click on ==Edit== to modify your own test topic again (or any other topic for that matter).
   * Now, let's create a new topic starting from your own test topic:
      1. In edit mode, enter a new text with a WikiWord, for example:%BR%
         =This is <nop>%WIKINAME%Sandbox topic.=
      1. Save the topic. The name appears highlighted with a red-link. This means that the topic doesn't exist yet.
      1. Click on the red-link. Now you're in edit mode for the new topic.
      1. Type some text. You can add headings, bullets, tables and more using the controls of the WYSIWYG editor.
      1. A signature with your name is already entered by default. Keep it at the bottom.%BR%
         __Note:__ The =%USERSWEB%.= in front of your name is a web prefix. It means that you have a link from the current web to your personal topic located in the %USERSWEB% web.
      1. Save the topic...
   * Link to another topic:
      1. In edit mode, enter the WikiWord of a topic that already exists in the Sandbox web, for example:%BR%
         =This links to <nop>WebSearch.=
      1. Save the topic. WebSearch is now a link you can click.%BR%
         __Note:__ WikiWords are linked automatically; there is no link if you look at the text in edit mode.
      1. You can also create a nice looking link without a !BumpyWord. Enter for example:%BR%
         =[<nop>[WebSearch][This is a link to search]].=
   * Learn about ==Raw Edit== (for advanced/technical users)
      1. Topics can be modified in WYSIWYG mode (default) and in ==Raw Edit== mode. Raw mode shows text in !TWikiShorthand, a very simple markup language. Follow the TWikiShorthand link to see how, then:
      1. Go back to your own sandbox topic and ==Raw Edit== it.
      2. Enter some text in TWikiShorthand: *bold* text, _italic_ text, __bold italic__ text, a bullet list, tables, paragraphs, etc.%BR%
       __Hint:__ If you need help, click on the [[TextFormattingRules][Edit help]] link located above the text edit box.
      3. Save the topic.
   * __%T% Tip:__ When you only want to see the source code of a topic click the ==Raw View== link.

---++ 7. Use your browser to upload files as page attachments...

You can attach _any_ type of file to a topic - documents, images, programs, whatever - where they can be opened, viewed, or downloaded. 
   * Attaching files is just like including a file with an e-mail.
      1. Go back to your sandbox topic and click on ==Attach==.
      1. Click ==[Browse]== to find a file on your machine that you'd like to attach; enter an optional comment; leave everything else unchecked.
      1. Click ==[Upload file]==, then scroll to the end of the page to see the new attachment listing.
   * Do this again - this time, upload a =.gif=, =.png=, or =.jpg= image file.
      * Check the =Link= box to _create a link to the attached file at the end of the topic_. The image will show up at the bottom of the topic. 
      * Edit the topic to move/resize the image.
   * If you have an image of yourself, your cat, your sprawling family estate...why not upload it now to personalize your TWiki profile page %WIKIUSERNAME%?

---++ 8. Get alerted whenever topics are changed...

%NOTIFYTOPIC% is a subscription service that automatically notifies you by e-mail when topics change in a TWiki web. This is a convenience service - for many people, checking e-mail is easier than checking the Web.
   * If you're using TWiki to collaborate on a project, it's important to know when anyone on your team posts an update. If you're following a specific discussion, it's convenient to know when there's new input.
   * Alerts are e-mailed as links to individual topics that have been changed in a set period: Each day, every hour, whatever is configured for your system.
   * It's strongly recommended that you try out the service by subscribing to each TWiki web that's relevant to you. You can subscribe and unsubscribe instantly, on a per web basis using %NOTIFYTOPIC%. 
   * If you prefer, you can subscribe to RSS and ATOM feeds. Every web has a WebRss feed and a WebAtom feed, respectively.

That's it! You're now equipped with all the TWiki essentials. You are ready to roll.

__%T% Note:__ When first using TWiki, it will probably seem strange to be able to change other people's postings - we're used to _separating_ individual messages, with  e-mail, message boards, non-wiki collaboration platforms. __Don't worry about it.__ You can't accidentally delete important stuff - you can always check previous versions, and copy-and-paste from them if you want to undo any changes. After a short while, TWiki-style free-form communication becomes second-nature. You'll expect it everywhere!

---# 20-Minute TWiki

This step-by-step, hands-on tutorial gets you up to speed with all the TWikiSite basics, in _mere minutes_...
<blockquote>
---++ 1. Get set...
Open two browser windows, so that you can follow these steps in one window, while trying things out in the other.

---++ 2. Take a quick tour...
A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one usually represents one area of collaboration. You can navigate the webs from the upper right corner of each web page.
	* Each web has hyperlinked topics, displayed as pages in your browser. 
	* The home page in each web is the %HOMETOPIC% topic.
	* To browse a TWiki web, just click on any highlighted link. These links are called WikiWords and comprise two or more words with initial capitals, run together. 
	* Follow the WikiWord link and learn what it is.
	* If you know the name of a topic, you can jump directly to it by typing its name into the *Go* field on the top of the page. Type =WebSearch= to jump to the search page. __Hint:__ Do not confuse the *Go* field with search.
	* You can search each TWiki web. Enter a search string in the %HOMETOPIC% topic or the WebSearch topic accessible from the =Search= link on each topic. TWiki searches for an exact match; optionally, you can also use RegularExpressions.

---++ 3. Open a private account...
To edit topics, you need to have a TWiki account.
	* Go to the TWikiRegistration page to create your TWiki account. Fill in a couple of lines and you're set!

---++ 4. Check out TWiki users, groups, offices...
	* Go to the %MAINWEB%.%WIKIUSERSTOPIC% topic in the TWiki.%MAINWEB% web; it has a list of all users of TWiki. Your WikiName will be in this list after you register.
	* Go to the %MAINWEB%.TWikiGroups topic in the TWiki.%MAINWEB% web; it has a list of groups which can be used to define fine grained TWikiAccessControl in TWiki.
	* Go to the %MAINWEB%.OfficeLocations topic in the TWiki.%MAINWEB% web; it has a sample list of corporate offices. This type of set-up can be used for departments, client companies, or any other type of organizational divisions.

---++ 5. Test the page controls...
Go to the [[#PageBottom][bottom of the page]] to see what you can do. The color-coded control strip has a collection of action links:
	* ==[Edit]== - add to or edit the topic (discussed later)
	* ==[Attach]== - attach files to a topic (discussed later)
	* ==[Ref-By]== - find out what other topics link to this topic (reverse link)
	* ==[Printable]== - goes to a stripped down version of the page, good for printing
	* ==[Diffs]== - topics are under revision control - =[Diffs]= shows you the complete change history of the topic, ex: who changed what and when.
	* ==[r1.3 | &gt; | r1.2 | &gt; | r1.1]== - view a previous version of the topic or the difference between two versions.
	* ==[More]== - additional controls, like ==[Rename/move]==, version control and setting the topic's parent.

---++ 6. Change a page, and create a new one...
Go to the [[Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%][Sandbox]]. This is the sandbox web, where you can make changes and try it all out at will.
	* Click the ==[Edit]== link. You are now in edit mode and you can see the source of the page. (Go to a different topic like Sandbox.TestTopic3 in case you see a "Topic is locked by an other user" warning.)
	* Look at the text in edit mode and compare it with the rendered page (move back and forth in your browser.)
	* Notice how WikiWords are linked automatically; there is no link if you look at the text in edit mode.
	* Now, create a new topic - your own test page:
		1. In edit mode, enter a new text with a WikiWord, ex: <br />
		  =This is <nop>YourOwnSandBox topic.=
		1. Preview and save the topic. The name appears, highlighted, with a linked question mark at the end. This means that the topic doesn't exist yet.
		1. Click on the question mark. Now you're in edit mode of the new topic.
		1. Type some text, basically, like you write an email.
		1. A signature with your name is already entered by default. __NOTE:__ The =%MAINWEB%.= in front of your name means that you have a link from the current web to your personal topic located in the %MAINWEB% web.
		1. Preview and save the topic...
	* Learn about text formatting. You can enter text in TWikiShorthand, a very simple markup language. Follow the TWikiShorthand link to see how, then:
		1. Go back to your sandbox topic end edit it.
		2. Enter some text in TWikiShorthand: *bold* text, _italic_ text, __bold italic__ text, a bullet list, tables, paragraphs, etc. __Hint:__ If you need help, click on the TextFormattingRules link located below the text box in edit mode.
		3. Preview and save the topic.

---++ 7. Use your browser to upload files as page attachments...
You can attach _any_ type of file to a topic - documents, images, programs, whatever - where they can be opened, viewed, or downloaded. 
	* Attaching files is just like including a file with an email.
		1. Go back to your sandbox topic and click on the ==[Attach]== link at the bottom.
		1. Click ==[Browse]== to find a file on your PC that you'd like to attach; enter an optional comment; leave everything else unchecked.
		1. Click ==[Upload file]==, then scroll to the end of the page to see the new attachment listing.
	* Do this again - this time, upload a GIF, JPG or PNG image file.
		* Check the ==[Link:]== box to _Create a link to the attached file at the end of the topic_. The image will show up at the bottom of the topic. 
		* To move the image, edit the topic and place the last line (containing =%<nop>ATTACHURL%=) anywhere on the page.
	* If you have a GIF, JPG or PNG image of yourself, your cat, your sprawling family estate...why not upload it now to personalize your account page: %MAINWEB%.%USERNAME%?

---++ 8. Get email alerts whenever pages are changed...
%NOTIFYTOPIC% is a subscription service that automatically notifies you by email when topics change in a TWiki web. This is a convenience service - for many people, checking email is easier than checking the Web.
	* If you're using TWiki to collaborate on a project, it's important to know when anyone on your team posts an update. If you're following a specific discussion, it's convenient to know when there's new input.
	* Alerts are emailed as links to individual topics that've been changed in a set period: each day, every hour, whatever is configured for your system.
	* It's strongly recommended that you try out the service by subscribing to each TWiki web that's relevant to you. You can subscribe and unsubscribe instantly, on a per web basis using %NOTIFYTOPIC%. 
</blockquote>
That's it! You're now equipped with all the TWiki essentials. You are ready to roll.

__NOTE:__ When first using TWiki, it will probably seem strange to be able to change other people's postings - we're used to _separating_ individual messages, with  email, message boards, non-Wiki collaboration platforms. __Don't worry about it.__ You can't accidentally delete important stuff - you can always check previous versions, and copy-and-paste from them if you want to undo any changes. After a short while, TWiki-style free-form communication becomes second-nature. You'll expect it everywhere!

a72 15
---+++ 7. Upload files as page Attachments:
You can attach any file to a topic, not unlike attachments to an email.
	* Go back to your sandbox topic and click on the =Attach= link at the bottom.
	* Browse for any file you would like to attach; enter an optional comment.

	* If you have a GIF or JPG image of yourself, why not upload it now to your personal topic?

---+++ 8. Get email alerts when topics change:
It is very important that team members are kept in sync of changes.
	* %NOTIFYTOPIC% (one per %WIKITOOLNAME% web) is a subscription service to be automatically notified by email when topics change in a %WIKITOOLNAME% web. This is a convenient service, so you do not have to come back and check all the time to see if something has changed.
	* It is strongly recommended that you subscribe to the %WIKITOOLNAME% web(s) relevant to your work.

__NOTE:__ When first using TWiki, it will probably seem strange to be able to change other people's postings - separated messages is the online rule, with email, message boards, non-Wiki collaboration platforms. __Don't worry about it.__ Nothing gets lost, you can always check previous versions, and copy-and-paste from them if you want to revert after saving a change. Use TWiki for a short while, and you'll want this sort of natural communications freedom...everywhere!

	* Preparation:
		* Open up a new browser window. While you are working in one window, you can look at the step-by-step tutorial instructions in the other window.
d75 1
a75 65
	* Navigation and search:
		* %WIKITOOLNAME% is divided up into webs; each one represents one area of collaboration. The webs are accessible at the upper right corner of each web page.
		* Each web has hyper-linked topics. A topic is one web page in your browser. 
		* The home page in each web is the %HOMETOPIC% topic.
		* To browse a %WIKITOOLNAME% web, just click on any highlighted link. These links are called WikiWords and comprise two or more words with initial capitals, run together. 
		* Follow the WikiWord link and learn what it is.
		* If you know the name of a topic, you can jump directly to it by typing its name into the *Go* field on the top of the page. Type =WebSearch= to jump to the search page. __Hint:__ Do not confuse the *Go* field with search.
		* You can search each %WIKITOOLNAME% web. Enter a search string in the %HOMETOPIC% topic or the WebSearch topic accessible from the =Search= link on each topic. %WIKITOOLNAME% searches for an exact match; optionally, you can also use RegularExpressions.

	* Create your account:
		* To edit topics, you need to have a %WIKITOOLNAME% account.
		* Go to the TWikiRegistration page to create your %WIKITOOLNAME% account.

	* %WIKITOOLNAME% Users and offices:
		* Go to the %MAINWEB%.%WIKIUSERSTOPIC% topic in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web; it has a list of all users of %WIKITOOLNAME%. Your WikiName will be in this list after you register.
		* Go to the %MAINWEB%.OfficeLocations topic in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web; it has a list of corporate offices already entered into %WIKITOOLNAME%.

	* Operations on topics:
		* Go to the %HOMETOPIC% topic to learn what we can do with a topic.
		* The bottom of the page has some links:
		* =Edit= : Allows you to edit the topic (discussed later)
		* =Ref-By= : Find out what other topics link to this topic (reverse link)
		* =Attach= : Attach files to a topic (discussed later)
		* =Diffs= : Topics are under revision control. Diffs shows you the complete change history of the topic, e.g. who changed what and when.
		* =r1.3 | > | r1.2 | > | r1.1= : Allows you to see a previous topic revision or the difference between revisions.

	* Editing a topic and creating hyperlinked pages:
		* Go to the Test.%HOMETOPIC% topic of the %WIKITOOLNAME%.Test web. This web is the sandbox where you can make changes at will.
		* Press the =Edit= link. You are now in edit mode and you can see the source of the page. (Go to a different topic like Test.TestTopic3 in case you see a "Topic is locked by an other user" warning.)
		* Look at the text in edit mode and compare it with the rendered page (move back and forth in your browser.)
		* Notice how WikiWords are linked automatically; there is no link if you look at the text in edit mode.
		* Now let's create a new topic, your own sandbox topic:
			* In edit mode, enter a new text with a WikiWord, i.e. <br>
			  =This is <nop>PaulsSandBox topic.=
			* Preview and save the topic.
			* You can see a linked question mark after the topic name. This means that the topic does not exist yet.
			* Click on the question mark. Now you are in edit mode of the new topic.
			* Type some text, basically like you write an email.
			* A signature with your name is already entered by default. __Note:__ Please note the =%MAINWEB%.= in front of your name. This means that you have a link from the current web to your personal topic located in the %MAINWEB% web.
			* Preview and save the topic.
		* Learn about text formatting:
			* You write text in WikiSyntax, a very simple markup language. Follow the WikiSyntax link and learn how to write text.
			* Go back to your sandbox topic end edit it.
			* Enter some text in WikiSyntax: *bold* text, _italic_ text, __bold italic__ text, a bullet list, tables, paragraphs, etc. __Hint:__ If you need to look up the WikiSyntax, click on the TextFormattingRules link located below the edit field.
			* Preview and save the topic.

	* Attaching files to a topic:
		* You can attach any file to a topic, not unlike attachments to an email.
		* Go back to your sandbox topic and click on the =Attach= link at the bottom.
		* Browse for any file you would like to attach; enter an optional comment.
		* Upload and attach the file.
		* Do this again with a JPG or GIF image file.
		* Checkmark the box "Create a link to the attached file at the end of the topic."
		* Upload and attach the image file.
		* The image will show up at the bottom of the topic. To move the image, you can edit the topic and move the last line (starting with =&lt;a href="%<nop>ATTACHURLPATH%/...=) to anywhere you like.
		* If you have a GIF or JPG image of yourself, why not upload it now to your personal topic?

	* Getting notified of topic changes:
		* It is very important that team members are kept in sync of changes.
		* %NOTIFYTOPIC% (one per %WIKITOOLNAME% web) is a subscription service to be automatically notified by email when topics change in a %WIKITOOLNAME% web. This is a convenient service, so you do not have to come back and check all the time to see if something has changed.
