@---+ Package =TWiki::Net=

Object that brokers access to network resources.


%TOC%

---++ ObjectMethod *finish* <tt>()</tt>
Break circular references.



---++ ObjectMethod *registerExternalHTTPHandler* <tt>(\&fn)</tt>

See TWikiFuncDotPm#RegisterExternalHTTPHandler



---++ ObjectMethod *getExternalResource* <tt>($url,\@@headers,\%params) -> $response</tt>

See TWikiFuncDotPm#GetExternalResource



---++ ObjectMethod *postExternalResource* <tt>($url,$content,\@@headers,\%params) -> $response</tt>

See TWikiFuncDotPm#PostExternalResource



---++ ObjectMethod *setMailHandler* <tt>(\&fn)</tt>

   * =\&fn= - reference to a function($) (see _sendEmailBySendmail for proto)
Install a handler function to take over mail sending from the default
SMTP or sendmail methods. This is provided mainly for tests that
need to be told when a mail is sent, without actually sending it. It
may also be useful in the event that someone needs to plug in an
alternative mail handling method.



---++ ObjectMethod *sendEmail* <tt>($text,$tries) -> $error</tt>

   * =$text= - text of the mail, including MIME headers
   * =$tries= - number of times to try the send (default 1)

Send an email specified as MIME format content.
Date: ...\nFrom: ...\nTo: ...\nCC: ...\nSubject: ...\n\nMailBody...

---+++ getExternalResource( $url, @@headers ) -> $response
d15 1
a15 46
Get whatever is at the other end of a URL (using an HTTP GET request). Will
only work for encrypted protocols such as =https= if the =LWP= CPAN module is
installed.

Note that the =$url= may have an optional user and password, as specified by
the relevant RFC. Any proxy set in =configure= is honored.

Optional headers may be supplied of form 'name1', 'value1', 'name2', 'value2'.
Do not add a User-Agent header, it will be added.

The =$response= is an object that is known to implement the following subset of
the methods of =LWP::Response=. It may in fact be an =LWP::Response= object,
but it may also not be if =LWP= is not available, so callers may only assume
the following subset of methods is available:
| =code()= |
| =message()= |
| =header($field)= |
| =content()= |
| =is_error()= |
| =is_redirect()= |

Note that if LWP is *not* available, this function:
   1 can only really be trusted for HTTP/1.0 urls. If HTTP/1.1 or another
     protocol is required, you are *strongly* recommended to =require LWP=.
   1 Will not parse multipart content

In the event of the server returning an error, then =is_error()= will return
true, =code()= will return a valid HTTP status code
as specified in RFC 2616 and RFC 2518, and =message()= will return the
message that was received from
the server. In the event of a client-side error (e.g. an unparseable URL)
then =is_error()= will return true and =message()= will return an explanatory
message. =code()= will return 400 (BAD REQUEST).

Note: Callers can easily check the availability of other HTTP::Response methods
as follows:

<verbatim>
my $response = TWiki::Func::getExternalResource($url);
if (!$response->is_error() && $response->isa('HTTP::Response')) {
    $text = $response->content();
    # ... other methods of HTTP::Response may be called
} else {
    # ... only the methods listed above may be called
}
</verbatim>
