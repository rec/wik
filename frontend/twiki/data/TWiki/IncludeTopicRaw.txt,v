---+!! INCLUDE a topic in the raw

When a topic is included, normally TWiki variables in the included topic are expanded in the context of the inlcluded topic. But if =raw="on"= is specified, that variable expansion does not happen.

This topic explains what it is for and what it really means.

---++ When a new topic is created based on a template topic

You can specify a template topic when you create a new topic.
Variable expansion during topic creation is different from usual.
It's explained [[TWikiTemplates#Variable_Expansion][here]].
Basically, variables are not expanded for the most part but you can force variable expansion by prepending =EOTC__= to a variable name.

Leveraging =INCLUDE= with =raw="on"=, a template topic can be composed of multiple topics.
Let's say there is a topic named !ThreePartTemplate as follows.
<verbatim>
%EOTC__INCLUDE{"TmplPartA" raw="on"}%
%EOTC__INCLUDE{"TmplPartB" raw="on"}%
</verbatim>
Thanks to =raw="on"=, TWiki variables in !TmplPartA and !TmplPartB are not expanded when those topics are included.
Since most variables are not expanded in topic creation, most variables in !TmplPartA and !TmplPartB are put as they are in the new topic.

Let's assume !TmplPartA contains =%<nop>CALENDAR%=. It will show up as is in a topic created based on !ThreePartTemplate.
   1. When !TmplPartA is included, no variable expansion happens.
   1. =%<nop>CALENDAR%= is not subject to expansion in topic creation, so it's left as is in the created topic.

If =raw="on'= wasn't present,
   1. When !TmplPartA was included, =%<nop>CALENDAR%= would be expanded in the context of !TmplPartA.
   1. As a result, the created topic would have an HTML table of a calendar rather than =%<nop>CALENDAR%= on it.

---++ When a topic is viewed

In viewing a topic, variable expansion always happen.

Let's say there is a topic named !IncludedTopic whose content is =%<nop>TOPIC%=.
<blockquote>
!IncludedTopic: =%<nop>TOPIC%=
</blockquote>

If that's included by another topic !IncludingTopic with =raw="on"= parameter and this enhancement is in effect, !IncludingTopic shows !IncludedTopic.
<blockquote>
!IncludingTopic: =%<nop>INCLUDE{"IncludedTopic" raw="on"}%= -&gt; !IncludingTopic
</blockquote>

This is because when !IncludedTopic is included by !IncludingTopic, the variable =%<nop>TOPIC%= is not expanded and
the processing of =%<nop>INCLUDE{"IncludedTopic" raw="on"}%= ends there.
Then, =%<nop>TOPIC%= is expanded in the !IncludingTopic's context.

On the other hand, if you don't have =raw="on"=, =%<nop>TOPIC%= is expanded in !IncludedTopic's context.
<blockquote>
!IncludingTopic: =%<nop>INCLUDE{"IncludedTopic"}%= -&gt; !IncludedTopic
</blockquote>
