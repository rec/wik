@---+ Package =TWiki::EngineException=

Exception used to raise an engine related error. This exception has the
following fields:
   * =status= - status code to send to client
   * =reason= a text string giving the reason for the refusal.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* <tt>($status,$reason[,$response])</tt>

   * =$status= - status code to send to client
   * =$reason= - string reason for failure
   * =$response= - custom TWiki::Response object to be sent to client. Optional.

All the above fields are accessible from the object in a catch clause
in the usual way e.g. =$e->{status}= and =$e->{reason}=



---++ ObjectMethod *stringify* <tt>() -> $string</tt>

Generate a summary string. This is mainly for debugging.
