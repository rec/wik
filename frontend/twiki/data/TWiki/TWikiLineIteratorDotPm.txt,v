Iterator over the lines in a file


%TOC%

---++ new( $file )

Create a new iterator over the given file. if the file cannot be opened, then
there will be no elements in the iterator.


---++ hasNext() -> $boolean

Returns false when the iterator is exhausted.

<verbatim>
my $it = new TWiki::ListIterator(\@@list);
while ($it->hasNext()) {
   ...
</verbatim>


---++ next() -> $data

Return the next line in the file.

The iterator object can be customised to pre- and post-process entries from
the list before returning them. This is done by setting two fields in the
iterator object:

   * ={filter}= can be defined to be a sub that filters each entry. The entry
     will be ignored (next() will not return it) if the filter returns false.
   * ={process}= can be defined to be a sub to process each entry before it
     is returned by next. The value returned from next is the value returned
     by the process function.

For example,
<verbatim>
my $it = new TWiki::LineIterator("/etc/passwd");
$it->{filter} = sub { $_[0] =~ /^.*?:/; return $1; };
$it->{process} = sub { return "User $_[0]"; };
while ($it->hasNext()) {
    my $x = $it->next();
    print "$x\n";
}
</verbatim>
