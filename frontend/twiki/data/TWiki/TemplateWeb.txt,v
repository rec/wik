---+!! Template Web

---++ Purpose

Template webs contain a set of default topics and act as templates when creating a new web. Names of template webs begin with an underscore "_" character, such as =_default=. Names of regular webs begin with an uppercase letter, such as =%USERSWEB%=. 

An administrator can select a template web from the "based on web" picklist when creating a new web in the ManagingWebs topic. Template webs are otherwise invisible.

The [[_default.%HOMETOPIC%][_default]] web template contains the following topics: =<nop>%HOMETOPIC%, <nop>WebAtom, <nop>WebChanges, <nop>WebCreateNewTopic, <nop>WebIndex, <nop>WebLeftBar, <nop>WebNotify, <nop>WebPreferences, <nop>WebRss, <nop>WebSearch, <nop>WebSearchAdvanced, <nop>WebStatistics, <nop>WebTopicList and <nop>WebTopMenu.=

---++ Customizing

The web template is useful for administrators to design for creating webs of a certain type.  Departmental webs can at least begin with a similar look and feel.

Simply create a web with an underscore for the first character.  These can be used by authorized users to create webs from this template.

Template webs were created to act as templates in creating webs.  It is now possible to create webs via the %SYSTEMWEB%.ManagingWebs topic.  In the not so distant past TWiki webs were created by hand.  The data directory contains the different webs such as *Main* and *TWiki*.  A web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character is considered invisible and a template.  All files in the *_default* (or any other web that begins with an underscore) template web will be copied into your new web.  The [[_default.%HOMETOPIC%][_default]] web template contains the following topics: =<nop>%HOMETOPIC%, <nop>WebChanges, <nop>WebIndex, <nop>WebNotify, <nop>WebPreferences, <nop>WebSearch, <nop>WebStatistics and <nop>WebTopicList.=
