---+ Package =TWiki::LoginManager::Session=

Class to provide CGI::Session like infra-structure, compatible with
TWiki Runtime Engine mechanisms other than CGI.

replacing by calls to TWiki::Request object, that is passed to constructor.

It also redefines =name= method, to avoid creating CGI object.
