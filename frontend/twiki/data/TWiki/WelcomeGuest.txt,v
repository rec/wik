---+!! Welcome, %WIKIUSERNAME%!

Welcome to <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME%! This is a TWikiSite (pronounced _twee-kee site_), a meeting place to work on common interests. Anyone can contribute using any web browser. <nop>%WIKITOOLNAME% looks like a normal web site... except that it encourages contribution and *editing* of pages, questions, answers, comments, updates, etc.

"Wiki" systems are fundamentally editable web pages.  It's a fun and useful way of communicating asynchronously over the web for many existing intranet and public Internet sites.  TWiki is simple to learn and use.  It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web.

%TOC%

---++ What's in a TWiki?

   * *Webs:* A TWikiSite is divided into webs, each one represents a workspace for collaboration. This site has the following webs: %IF{ "{NoInAllPublicWebs}" then="[[%USERSWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%][%USERSWEB%]], [[%SYSTEMWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%][%SYSTEMWEB%]], [[Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%][Sandbox]], and many others." else="$percntWEBLIST{ format=\"[[$name.%HOMETOPIC%][$name]]\" separator=\", \" }$percnt." }%
   * *Topics:* Each web is made up of hyperlinked [[TWikiTopics][topics]] (wiki pages) that appear in your browser.

---++ Some things to do

   * *Browse.* This is a site like other sites. Read and follow interesting links.
   * *Write.* Speak your mind! From your browser you can change or add to anything you see in a TWiki topic. Modify content with an easy to use WYSIWYG editor.
   * *Experiment.* Visit the Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC% web and create as many topics as you like.
   * *Organize.* You can learn to use TWikiForms and [[FormattedSearch][formatted searches]] with [[QuerySearch][SQL-like queries]] to include topic information - for example, classify pages by subject, status, or date.
   * *Learn more.* Some good places to start:
      * TWikiTutorial is a 20-minute tour of TWiki essentials. 
      * ATasteOfTWiki is a short introduction training course for beginners. 
      * WikiReferences links to selected articles and books about wiki technology and online collaboration.
      * WikiSyntax - simple wiki syntax for those using raw edit instead of WYSIWYG editor
      * GoodStyle - recommendations for edits
 
---++ Some basics

---+++ Editing a topic

   * Click ==Edit== at the top or bottom of any topic and make your changes.
     %BR% __Note:__ Don't worry if you make a mistake. Everything is version controlled, you can easily go back in time.
   * Click ==Save== - you've now updated the topic!

---+++ Creating a new topic

   * See a red-colored WikiWord? That means that there's no topic yet for that Sandbox.NewWikiWord%CALCULATE{$INT($RAND(100000))}%. Simply click on the red-link to create a topic with that name. Add your content and save. Done!
   * To create your own topic, invent a !BrandNewWikiWord name and put it into an existing topic. Click on the red-link of !BrandNewWikiWord to create the topic. 

---+++ Viewing the history of a topic

   * Click ==History== at the bottom of a topic.

---+++ Attaching files and images

   * Click ==Attach== to upload and attach any type of file.
   * When attaching an image file (=.gif=, =.png=, =.jpg=), check the "link" checkbox to embed the image into the topic. Edit the topic to move/resize the image.

---+++ Embedding objects

   * ==Raw edit== a topic and paste !YouTube videos, Twitter feeds and other objects.

		* *Topic:* Each web is made up of hyperlinked [[TWikiTopics][topics]] that appear in your browser.
		* *WebChanges:* In each TWiki web to find what's new
	1. *Write.* Speak your mind! From your browser you can change or add to anything you see in a TWiki topic. Use regular text or TWikiShorthand. To contribute:
		* *Create An Account.* To be able to edit or write new content, you'll need to create an account for yourself. It's simple, and only takes a minute.  TWikiRegistration  This will also create your personal home page.

		* click ==[&nbsp;Save&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]==
	1. *Don't worry!* It can be scary at first to change "public" content. Please just try it. _Revision control_ keeps all content, nothing is lost.  For special cases, [[TWikiAccessControl][access control]] is available yet you may find you don't need it in most cases. You'll soon see how successful WikiCulture works in this kind of collaboration environment. This is new.  Just try to relax.
	1. *Experiment.*  Edit your personal page or visit the Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC% web.
		1. *Link.* To link to another topic, start by editing an existing topic.
			* To create a link to an existing topic type its ==JoinCapitalizedWords== name.  WikiWords (two or more capitalized words run together) link automatically.
		1. *Create a new topic.* To create a new topic, start by editing an existing topic.
			* In an existing topic, create a link to a new topic, entering a newly ==UsedPhrase== as a !WikiWord.
			* After saving the existing topic you will see a question mark link "<u>?</u>" behind the !WikiWord.
			* Click on the question mark to create the new topic.
		1. *Topic history.* Click ==History== at the bottom of a topic
		1. *Attach files.* Click ==Attach== to upload and attach any type of file.

<H3>Welcome, %WIKIUSERNAME%!</H3>
d4 5
a8 1
You have reached a TWikiSite (pronounced _twee-kee site_). TWiki is a meeting place where people collaborate on common interests. Anyone can contribute using a regular Web browser. TWiki looks like a normal Web site, but it allows (and encourages) everyone to *freely edit the pages* by contributing questions, answers, comments, changes - ideas can be transformed into published input, instantly. TWiki is very simple to learn and use, and provides possibly the most powerful way to exchange and develop ideas online, in an open, uncomplicated environment.
d12 50
a61 48
	1. *Read:* You can treat this site like any other. Browse, and follow interesting links. A couple of hints:
		* *web:* A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one represents one subject, one area of collaboration. You can reach any web from the links in the upper right corner of every page.
		* *topic:* Each web is made up of hyperlinked topics - TWikiTopics that appear in your browser.
		* *What's new:* Visit WebChanges in any TWiki web to see what other people are discussing and what's been added most recently.
	1. *Create an Account:* To be able to write new content on this site, you'll need to create an account for yourself. It's simple, and only takes a minute: just visit TWikiRegistration and fill out the form. This will also create your personal home page.
	1. *Write:* If you have something to say, speak your mind! Anyone can change or add to anything they see written in a TWiki topic. You can edit a topic from within your browser, using TWikiShorthand, a very simple markup language (you can also use HTML if you like, but you'll usually find you can get the same results more easily with TWikiShorthand). To contribute:
		* click the ==Edit== link at the bottom of the page, edit the text, and then
		* click the ==[&nbsp;Preview&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== button at the bottom of the page to see what your topic will look like (use your brower's ==Back== button if you want to make changes), and finally
		* click the ==[&nbsp;Save&nbsp;Changes&nbsp;]== to save what you did.
	1. *Do you find this...scary?!* Anybody can do anything! That's not how things are usually done. It's...uncontrollable. And yet, collaborating in the Wiki way works! Try it out for even a couple of minutes. Take a look at WikiCulture. (And then, with TWiki, you can define fine-grained TWikiAccessControl, based on users and groups, whenever and wherever you feel its necessary, across a site, a web, or page by page, if you like. And there's also full revision control that retains all changes, for good measure!)
	1. *Experiment:* To get your virtual hands dirty, visit [[Sandbox.%HOMETOPIC%][Sandbox]] web, where you can try out anything at all, in a consequence-free environment!
	1. *Create a link:* To link to another topic, start by editing an existing topic.
		* To create a link to a topic that already exists, type its ==JoinCapitalizedWords== name (topics are automatically linked if they are WikiWords, names composed of two or more words with initial capitals, run together).
		* To create a link to a page that does not yet exist, make up and enter a ==NeverBeforeUsedPhrase==. You are encouraged to include WikiWords in your content, for others to fill out later.
		* When you've saved the topic, and redisplayed it, the references to existing topics will be linked and the references to topics that don't exist will be followed by a linked "<u>?</u>" (question mark).
	1. *Create a topic:*
		* To write something up for a new topic, click on the "<u>?</u>" (question mark) that follows a WikiWord.
		* To create a free-floating topic - a topic that is not linked from anywhere - type its WikiWord in the entry field at the top of any page. If the topic already exists you'll then be taken to it. If it doesn't exist, you'll then have the option to create it.
	1. *See the history of a topic:* Click the ==Diffs== link on the control strip at the bottom of every page to see a complete history of edits for that topic.
	1. *Attach files:* Use your browser to upload and attach any type of file to a topic using the ==Attach== link at the bottom of the page.
	1. *Organize:* Use TWikiForms to include specific information with individual topics - for example, classify pages by subject, status, or date.
	1. *Learn more*: TWikiTutorial takes you on a 20-minute tour of the TWiki essentials. WikiReferences links to selected articles and books about online collaboration, and Wiki technology in particular.

*Main Features of TWiki*

	* Create and edit pages, and use all other features, through any Web browser.
	* Web pages are automatically linked. You do not need to learn HTML commands to link pages.
	* Very simple text formatting. Basically, you write a page the same way you would write an email.

	* All changes to pages and attachments are under revision control. Find out who changed what and when.
	* Fine-grained access control based on users and groups.

Welcome %WIKIUSERNAME%,

You have reached a TWikiSite (pronounced twee-kee site). TWiki is a meeting place where people collaborate on common interests. Anyone can contribute using a regular Web browser. TWiki looks like a normal Web site, but it allows (and ecourages) everyone to *edit the web pages* and contribute their questions and input. It really is very simple to learn and use, and provides possibly the most powerful way to exchange and develop ideas online, in an open, uncomplicated environment.

*How %WIKITOOLNAME% Works*

%WIKITOOLNAME% is divided up into *webs* ; each one represents one area of collaboration. The webs are accessible at the upper right corner. Our %WIKITOOLNAME% webs:

%INCLUDE{"TWikiWebsTable"}%

Each web has hyper-linked topics. A *topic* is one web page in your browser.

To browse this %WIKITOOLNAME% site, just click on any highlighted link. These links are called WikiWords, and comprise two or more words with initial capitals, run together. 

To edit any topic, click on "Edit" at the bottom of the topic. You can edit the topic from within your browser, using WikiSyntax, a very simple markup language. You could also use HTML if you wish, but this is optional. (Before you can edit pages you need to register in TWikiRegistration.)

A highlighted "?" following a WikiTopic means that no content has yet been entered for that topic. You are invited to add some content by clicking on the "?". You are encouraged to include WikiWords in your content, for others to fill out later.

Please follow the TWikiTutorial to get you up to speed on TWiki. You can use the <a href="../Test/WebHome">%WIKITOOLNAME%.Test</a> web for testing.
