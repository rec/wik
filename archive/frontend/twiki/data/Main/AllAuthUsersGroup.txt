---+ %PARENTBC% All Authenticated Users Group

This is a special group all authenticated users belong. The main use of this group is to lift a web level restriction at the topic level.

This is close to [[AllUsersGroup]]. The difference is that unauthenticated users belong to [[AllUsersGroup]] but not to [[AllAuthUsersGroup]]. 

Let's say a web is viewable only by the members of the !DarkSideGroup by the following line on !WebPreferences.
<pre>
   * <nop>Set ALLOWWEBVIEW = %USERSWEB%.DarkSideGroup
</pre>
By putting the following line on a topic, you can make it viewable by anybody authenticated.
<pre>
   * <nop>Set ALLOWTOPICVIEW = %USERSWEB%.AllAuthUsersGroup
</pre>

This topic is not necessary for the group to work because the group is implemented in the code instead of a topic that has members.
