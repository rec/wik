---+ Main Features of TWiki

   * *Any web browser:* Edit existing pages or create new pages by using any web browser. There is no need to upload pages.
   * *Edit link:* To edit a page, simply click on the =[Edit]= link at the top or bottom of the page.
   * *Auto links:* Web pages are [[WikiWord][linked automatically]]. You do not need to learn HTML commands to link pages.
   * *Text formatting:* Simple, powerful and easy-to-learn [[WikiSyntax][text formatting rules]]. Basically you write text like you would write an e-mail.
   * *Webs:* Pages are grouped into [[SiteMap][TWiki webs]] (or workspaces). This allows you to set up separate collaboration groups.
   * *Search:* [[WebSearch][Full text search]] with/without regular expressions. See a sample [[%SCRIPTURL{view}%/%WEB%/WebSearch?search=learn][search result]].
   * *E-mail notification:* Get [[WebChangesAlert][automatically notified]] when something has changed in a TWiki web.
   * *Structured content:* Use TWikiForms to classify and categorize unstructured web pages, and to create simple to complex web applications.
   * *File attachments:* [[FileAttachment][Upload]] and download any file as an attachment to a page by using your browser. This is similar to file attachments in an e-mail, but it happens on web pages.
   * *Revision control:* All changes to pages and attachments are tracked. Retrieve previous page revisions; compare differences; find out who changed what and when.
   * *Access control:* Define groups and impose fine-grained read and write [[TWikiAccessControl][access restrictions]] based on groups and users.
   * *Variables:* Use [[TWikiVariables][variables]] to dynamically compose your pages. This allows you for example to dynamically build a table of contents, include other pages, or show a search result embedded in a page.
   * *TWiki plugins:* Easily install program enhancements using external [[TWikiPlugins][plug-in modules]]. Developers can create plugins in Perl using the TWiki Plugin API.
   * *Templates and skins:* A flexible [[TWikiTemplates][templating system]] separates program logic and presentation. [[TWikiSkins][Skins]] overwrite template headers and footers; page content is unaffected.
   * *Managing pages:* Individual [[TWikiTopics][pages]] can be renamed, moved and deleted through the browser.
   * *Managing users:* Web-based [[TWikiRegistration][user registration]] and [[ChangePassword][change of password]].
   * *Statistics:* Create statistics of TWiki webs. Find out most popular pages and top contributors.
   * *Preferences:* Three levels of preferences: TWikiPreferences for site-level, WebPreferences for each web, and user level preferences.
   * *Simultaneous page editing:* More than one person can [[SimultaneousEdits][edit a page at the same time]].
   * *Backlinks:* Find the pages that contain links to a topic.
