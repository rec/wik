%STARTINCLUDE%
---+ Managing Webs

_Adding, renaming and deleting webs are all web-based operations._

%TOC%

---++ Overview

A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one represents one workspace, one area of collaboration. Each web is a container for topics. Each topic is a container for page content and attachments. Administrators can add/rename/delete webs.

#NamespaceAndURL
---++ Namespace and URL

The name of the web and topic is represented in the page URL. For example, =http://twiki.example.com/do/view/Sandbox/WebNotify= tells us that we __view__ topic __WebNotify__ located in the __Sandbox__ web.

%T% __Tip:__ The URL of a web's homepage ends in =/%HOMETOPIC%= by default. The name of the homepage topic can safely be omitted to make for shorter and more legible links. For example, =http://twiki.example.com/do/view/Sandbox= links to the homepage of the Sandbox web.

#WebTemplate
---++ Choose Web Template

New webs are based on a web you specify. There are two types of webs you can use to create a new web:
   * Use a specially designed TemplateWeb. This is an invisible web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character (for example =_default=).
   * Use an existing web as a template web. This may be useful if you already have a web that you would like to use as a starting point.

In either case all topics in the template web will be copied into the new web. Make sure to verify that your new web has all the custom modifications that you desire. Any settings defined in the form below will automatically be set in the !WebPreferences of the new web.

#CreateNewWeb
---++ Adding a New Web

<form name="admin" action="%SCRIPTURL{"manage" web="%WEB%"}%/%TOPIC%" method="post">
Create a new web by filling out this form.%BR%
__%X% Note:__ *Keep the number of webs to a minimum!* Don't create a new web for each little project. Cross-linking topics is easier, and searches are faster, if there are only a few larger webs. You can organize content within a web using categories, TWikiForms and FormattedSearch.
|  *Name of new web:* | <input name="newweb" class="twikiInputField" type="text" value="%URLPARAM{"newweb" encode="entity"}%" size="16" /> | The name must start with an upper case letter, followed by upper or lower case letters or numbers. Specify a short name to avoid long URLs. |
|  *Based on web:* | <select name="baseweb" class="twikiSelect"> %WEBLIST{ "<option $marker>$name</option>" webs="webtemplate%IF{"{NoInAllPublicWebs}" else=",public"}%" selection="_default" separator=" "}% </select> | Select a TemplateWeb. |
|  *Exclude Topic:* | <input type="text" class="twikiInputField" name="excludetopic" value="" size="60" /><br /> Enter comma separated list of topics to exclude from the template web. For example, =Data*= excludes all topics whose name starts with Data.%BR%<noautolink>%TWISTY{mode="div"
 showlink="Specify exception (you don't need to change most of the time) %ICONURL{toggleopen}%"
 hidelink="Hide exception %ICONURL{toggleclose}%"}%<input name="excludeexception" class="twikiInputField" size="60" value="%VAR{CREATE_WEB_EXCLUDE_EXCEPTION}%"/>%BR%e.g. if =*Form= is specified as exception, =DataForm= is copied even if =Data*= is specified to be excluded. %ENDTWISTY%</noautolink>||
|  *Web color:* | %COLORPICKER{ name="WEBBGCOLOR" size="16" value="#d0d0d0" class="twikiInputField" }% | Select color for the new web, shown in the list of webs.<br /><br /> __Note:__ Use a light color within the top 1/4th area of the center square depicting the saturation/luminance gradients. |
|  *Site Map:* | <input type="radio" name="SITEMAPLIST" value="on" checked="checked" /> Yes &nbsp; <input type="radio" name="SITEMAPLIST" value="" /> No | Include this web in the site map |
|  *Description:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;* | <input type="text" class="twikiInputField" name="SITEMAPWHAT" value="" size="60" /><br /> Enter a short description of the web. Write =[<nop>[Web.TopicName][title]]= instead of just =TopicName= if you include links. This description will be used in the %SYSTEMWEB%.SiteMap. ||
|  *Hidden:* | <input type="radio" name="NOSEARCHALL" value="on" /> Yes &nbsp; <input type="radio" name="NOSEARCHALL" value="" checked="checked" /> No | Specify if you want to exclude the web from a "search all webs" search. *This will not prevent users accessing the web*, it will simply hide it from searches. Use [[TWikiAccessControl][access control]] if needed. |
| *&nbsp;* | <input type="submit" class="twikiSubmit" value="Create new web" /> ||
<input name="newtopic" type="hidden" value="%URLPARAM{"newtopic" encode="entity"}%" />
<input name="action" type="hidden" value="createweb" />
</form>

__Notes:__
   * You must have =ROOTCHANGE= access to create a top-level web (one with no parent)
   * Only the person who created it has permission to change the <nop>%WEBPREFSTOPIC% in the new web

---++ Hierarchical Webs

You can only create hierarchical webs (webs within webs) if the ={EnableHierarchicalWebs}= setting in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] is enabled. Hierarchical webs are currently %IF{"{EnableHierarchicalWebs}" then="enabled." else="disabled. Without this setting, TWiki will only allow a single level of hierarchy. With it, you can use multiple levels, like a directory tree, i.e. webs within webs."}%

__%T% Note:__ You might not need hierarchical webs. TWiki topics already have a parent/child relationship within a web, which is shown in the breadcrumb. Try to keep the number of webs to a minimum in order to keep search and cross-referencing simple. TWiki runs faster if hierarchical webs are disabled.

You can create hierarchical webs via the _Adding a New Web_ form above, by using a slash- or dot-separated path name which is based on an existing web name in the _Name of new web:_ field.

*Example:*

To create a sub-web named =Bar= inside a web named =Foo=, use =Foo/Bar= or =Foo.Bar= as the new web name in the form above.

---+++ Sub-web Preferences are Inherited

The preferences of a sub-web are inherited from the parent web and overridden locally.  Preferences are ultimately inherited from the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] topic.

*Example Preference Inheritance for =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.SubWebTopic= topic:*

   1. =%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences= site-wide preferences
   2. =Sandbox.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= inherits from and overrides settings in =%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences=
   3. =Sandbox/TestWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= inherits from and overrides settings in =Sandbox.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%=
   4. =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= inherits from and overrides settings in =Sandbox/TestWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= 
   5. =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.SubWebTopic= inherits from and overrides settings in =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= 

---+++ Navigation

The PatternSkin indicates sub-webs by indenting them in the sidebar relative to their level in the hierarchy. The SiteMap shows a list of webs; sub-webs are separated by dots, such as =Web.SubWeb.SubSubWeb=.

#RenameWeb
---++ Renaming or Deleting a Web

Rename a web via the Tools section in each web's %WEBPREFSTOPIC% topic. You may delete a web by moving it into a Trash web.  

---+++ Permissions

You may only rename a web if you have the following permissions
   * You must be allowed to rename and changes topics in the web you want to rename
   * You must be allowed to rename topics in the parent web of the web you want to rename
   * If the web is a root web (i.e. it has no parent web) then you must have permission to both create and rename root webs. These permissions are controlled by the ALLOWROOTCHANGE preference, which can be set in [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences]].
   * If you move the web to another parent web you must be allowed to create and change topics in the new parent web.
   
When you rename a web TWiki will try and update all links that refer to the old web. You should note that links only get updated in topics that you are allowed to edit. If you use access rights in the TWiki installation it is generally best to let an administrator rename webs to avoid too many broken links. 

---+++ Edit Conflicts

If anyone is editing a topic which requires updating, or which lives in the web being renamed, a second confirmation screen will come up which will indicate which topics are still locked for edit.  You may continue to hit the refresh button until an edit lease is obtained for each topic which requires updating (the "Refresh" button will change to "Submit"), or hit "Cancel", which will cancel your edit lease on all affected topics.

---+++ Renaming the %SYSTEMWEB% or %USERSWEB% webs

Although technically possible, it is strongly advised __not__ to rename the %SYSTEMWEB% and %USERSWEB% webs. It complicates upgrades, and some extensions may make assumptions on the names of those system webs. For this reason, the rename web link is disabled in the <nop>%WEBPREFSTOPIC% topic in those webs.

__%H% Suggestion:__ Create a web that is the entry point for your TWiki, and change the link of the upper left site logo to that web. Do that with a WIKILOGOURL setting in [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]].

If you want to rename the %SYSTEMWEB% or %USERSWEB% webs anyway:
   * Physically move the webs below =twiki/data= and =twiki/pub= on the shell level.
   * Change the ={SystemWebName}=, ={UsersWebName}= and/or ={LocalSitePreferences}= settings in the configuration using the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] interface.

There are two methods used to create a new web.  First you can use a specially designed TemplateWeb.  This is an invisible web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character (for example =_default=).  All topics in the template web will be copied into your new web.

The second method is to use an existing web as a template web.  This may be useful if you already have a web that you would like to use as a starting point.  Only topics that have names beginning with *Web...* (like "%HOMETOPIC%", "%NOTIFYTOPIC%", etc.) are copied.

In either case you will want to be sure to verify that your new web has all the custom modifications that you desire. Any TWikiVariables defined in the form below will automatically be set in the !WebPreferences of the new web.

If you plan to rename the %USERSWEB% web, remember that TWiki stores user topics in this web. That means that every WikiName signature - =%USERSWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName= - points to it and would need updating (unless the variable, =%<nop>USERSWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName=, is used throughout). This potentially large change can be performed automatically if you rename the web from the Tools section of %WEBPREFSTOPIC%, as described above.

%X% If you want to rename the %SYSTEMWEB% or %USERSWEB% webs, remember they are referred to in the TWiki configuration.

#RenameWeb
---++ Renaming or Deleting a Web

Rename a web via the Tools section in each web's %WEBPREFSTOPIC% topic.  You may delete a web by moving it into a Trash web.  

---+++ Permissions

You may only rename a web if you have permissions to rename all the topics within that web, including any topics in that web's subwebs.  You will also need permissions to update any topics containing references to that web.

---+++ Edit Conflicts

If anyone is editing a topic which requires updating, or which lives in the web being renamed, a second confirmation screen will come up which will indicate which topics are still locked for edit.  You may continue to hit the refresh button until an edit lease is obtained for each topic which requires updating (the "Refresh" button will change to "Submit"), or hit "Cancel", which will cancel your edit lease on all affected topics.

---+++ Renaming the webs in the distribution

If you plan to rename the %MAINWEB% web, remember that TWiki stores user and group topics in this web. That means that every WikiName signature - =%MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName= - points to it and would need updating (unless the variable, =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName=, is used throughout). This potentially large change can be performed automatically if you rename the web from the Tools section of %WEBPREFSTOPIC%, as described above.

%X% If you want to rename the %TWIKIWEB% or %MAINWEB% webs, remember they are referred to in the TWiki configuration. You will need to change the ={SystemWebName}=, ={UsersWebName}= and/or ={LocalSitePreferences}= settings in the configuration using the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] interface.
d46 1
a46 1
Hierarchical web support is enabled by turning on the ={EnableHierarchicalWebs}= setting in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]]. Without this setting, TWiki will only allow a single level of hierarchy (webs). If you set this, you can use multiple levels, like a directory tree, i.e. webs within webs.
d58 1
a58 1
The preferences of a subweb are inherited from the parent web and overridden locally.  Preferences are ultimately inherited from the [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] topic.

---# Managing Webs

_Adding webs is a web based operation; renaming and deleting webs are manual operations done directly on the server_

---++ Overview

A TWikiSite is divided into webs; each one represents one subject, one area of collaboration. Administrators can add/rename/delete webs.

#WebTemplate
---++ Choose Web Template

There are two methods used to create a new web.  First you can use a specially designed TemplateWeb.  This is an invisible web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character.  All topics in the _default template web will be copied into your new web.

The second method is to use an existing web as a template web.  This may be useful if you already have a web that you like to use as a starting point.  Only topics that have names beginning with *Web...* (like "%HOMETOPIC%", "%NOTIFYTOPIC%", etc.) are copied.

In either case you will want to be sure to verify that your new web has all the custom modifications that you desire.

#CreateNewWeb
---++ Adding a New Web

<form name="admin" action="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/manage%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%INTURLENCODE{"%WEB%/%TOPIC%"}%" method="post">
Create a new web by filling out this form. __Note:__ It is not recommended to create a new web for each little project. You can organize content within a web using TWikiForms and FormattedSearch. Cross-linking topics and search is easier if there are only a few larger webs.
|  *Name of new web:* | <input name="newweb" type="text" value="%URLPARAM{"newweb"}%" size="16" /> | Enter a short name of up to 10 characters. The name must start with one or more upper case letters, followed by optional lower case letters or numbers; it cannot be a %TWIKIWEB%.WikiWord |
|  *Based on web:* | <select name="baseweb"> %WEBLIST{ "<option>$name</option>" webs="webtemplate,public" selection="_default" separator=" "}% </select> | Select a TemplateWeb |
|  *Web color:* | <input name="webbgcolor" type="text" value="#D0D0D0" size="16" /> | Enter a StandardColors code for the web |
|  *Description:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;* | <input type="text" name="sitemapwhat" value="" size="60" /><br /> Enter a short description of the web. Write =Web.TopicName= instead of just =TopicName= if you include links. This will list the web in the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap (leave field empty if you prefer not to update the directory.) ||
|  *Use to...<br /> &nbsp;* | <input type="text" name="sitemapuseto" value="...collaborate on" size="60" /><br /> Continue the sentence describing the intended use. This is also for the %TWIKIWEB%.SiteMap ||

| | <input type="submit" value="Create new web" /> ||
<input name="newtopic" type="hidden" value="%URLPARAM{"newtopic"}%" />
<input name="action" type="hidden" value="createweb" />
</form>

*Note:* Attachments will NOT get copied over along with their topics.  This will be a feature added for the TWiki:Codev/CairoRelease.

*Note:* This script does not yet edit the [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] file to update the =WIKIWEBLIST=.  This must be done by hand.

The manage script while creating the new web will update the following variables in the WebPreferences: =WEBBGCOLOR=, =SITEMAPLIST=, =SITEMAPWHAT=, =SITEMAPUSETO= and =NOSEARCHALL=.  These variables are now used to dynamically generate the SiteMap.

---++ Renaming or Deleting a Web

Renaming or deleting a web requires direct access to the installation files on the host server. There are currently no browser-based equivalents of the Rename/move/delete topic tools for working with webs.

*NOTE:* If you plan to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, remember that TWiki stores user and group topics in =%<nop>MAINWEB%=, default named =Main=. That means, every WikiName signature - =Main.<nop>SomeUserName= - points to it and would need updating (unless the variable, =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName=, is used throughout).
	1. Prepare your site: Search each web for links to the target web, searching topic text for =Oldwebname.=, including the dot so you'll find references like =Oldwebname.SomeTopic=. 
		* Make changes as required, to =Newwebname.SomeTopic= or better yet, to =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>SomeTopic=.
	1. Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic: Rename or delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	1. Login to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server, via Telnet or FTP.
	1. Go to =twiki/data= and rename or remove the web directory.
	1. Go to =twiki/templates= and rename or remove the web directory if present.

*NOTE:* Think twice if you intend to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, since many files point to it. If you rename it, you also have to change all occurrences of =Main= to the new web name (like the web prefixes for all user signatures, =Main.<nop>SomeName=). (On the other hand, if the =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is used throughout, you won't have that problem.)
	1. Prepare your site: Other webs may link to the web you want to rename or delete. Search each web for links to the target web: search all webs for =Abouttochange.= - include the period to find topics like =Abouttochange.SomeTopic=. Make changes as required.

	1. Connect to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server: Login via Telnet or FTP.
	1. Edit the data files: Go to =twiki/data= and rename or delete the web directory.
	1. Edit the template files: Go to =twiki/templates= and rename or delete the web directory if present.

Adding, renaming and deleting webs is done directly on the server

To work with entire TWiki webs, you need direct access to the installation files on the host server. Connecting by Telnet or FTP is the usual approach. There are no browser-based web management tools. You can prepare a web for changes through browser-based individual topics by browser (see [[TWiki.ManagingTopics][ModifyTopics]]).

	* *NOTE:* Think twice if you intend to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, since many files point to it. If you do rename it, you'll also have to change all occurrences of =Main= to the new web name - this includes, for example, the user signatures across your entire TWiki site. (On the other hand, if the variable ==%<nop>MAINWEB%== is used throughout, you have no problem.)
	1. *Prepare your site:* Other webs may link to the web you want to rename or delete. Search each web for links to the target web: search all webs for =Abouttochange.= - include the period to find topics like =Abouttochange.SomeTopic=. Make changes as required.
	1. *Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic:* Rename or delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	1. *Edit the TWikiWebsTable topic:* Rename or delete the web from the table.
	1. *Connect to the %WIKITOOLNAME% server:* Login via Telnet or FTP.
	1. *Edit the data files:* Go to ==twiki/data== and rename or delete the web directory.
	1. *Edit the template files:* Go to ==twiki/templates== and rename or delete the web directory if present.
	1. *Edit the public files:* Go to ==twiki/pub== and rename or delete the web directory if present.

Before making changes to a web, you can move individual topics through your browser (see [[TWiki.ManagingTopics][ModifyTopics]]). No similar web controls are available through the browser interface.

The current implementation of %WIKITOOLNAME% is designed to never forget.  So you can't delete a topic, however you can move or rename a topic and the original information is saved in topic meta data.  If you want an even stronger memory, you can disable renaming on some or all topics; see TWikiAccessControl.

	* It is advisable not to rename the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web.
	* Be aware that other webs might link to the web you want to rename / delete. Search each web for links to this web, i.e. search all webs for =Obsolete.= (include the period, this is to find topics like =Obsolete.SomeTopic= ). Take measures if necessary.
	* Edit the %WIKIPREFSTOPIC% topic and rename / delete the web from the =WIKIWEBLIST= variable.
	* Edit the TWikiWebsTable topic and rename / delete the web from the table.
	* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
	* cd to ==twiki/data== and rename / delete the web directory.
	* cd to ==twiki/templates== and rename / delete the web directory if present.
	* cd to ==twiki/pub== and rename / delete the web directory if present.

The current implementation of %WIKITOOLNAME% is designed to never forget, that means all topic changes are under revision control and you can't delete or rename topics. 

Nevertheless there are cases where you wish to delete topics. %WIKITOOLNAME% requires administrative stuff like that to be done on the shell level, so please ask your %WIKITOOLNAME% administrator to do that for you. A future version will allow administrators to do that on the browser level.

---+++ How to Rename or Delete a Topic

	* Go to the topic you want to rename / delete.
	* Find out the back-links to this page from _Ref-By_ . Modify other topics if needed.
	* Telnet to the %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.
	* cd to ==twiki/data== and then to the web where the topic is located. Rename / delete the topic ( ==name.txt== ) and repository file ( ==name.txt,v== ). __Hint:__ Instead of deleting a topic you could create a ==Trash== web and move topics/repositories to this web. (A future version of TWiki might have a Trash web.)
	* Edit the ==.changes== file and rename / delete all occurrences of the topic. __Note:__ There might be several lines of the topic.
	* cd to ==twiki/pub== and then to the web where the topic is located. Rename / delete the topic attachment directory if present.
