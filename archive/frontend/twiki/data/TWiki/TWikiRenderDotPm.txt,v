@---+ Package =TWiki::Render=

This module provides most of the actual HTML rendering code in TWiki.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* <tt>($session)</tt>

Creates a new renderer



---++ ObjectMethod *finish* <tt>()</tt>
Break circular references.



---++ ObjectMethod *renderParent* <tt>($web,$topic,$meta,$params) -> $text</tt>

Render parent meta-data



---++ ObjectMethod *renderMoved* <tt>($web,$topic,$meta,$params) -> $text</tt>

Render moved meta-data



---++ StaticMethod *chompUtf8Fragment* <tt>($str) -> $str</tt>

String truncation may happen in the middle of a UTF-8 byte sequence.
This function gets rid of the truncated fragment.



---++ ObjectMethod *makeAnchorName* <tt>($anchorName,$compatibilityMode) -> $anchorName</tt>

   * =$anchorName= - the unprocessed anchor name
   * =$compatibilityMode= - SMELL: compatibility with *what*?? Who knows. :-(

Build a valid HTML anchor name



---++ ObjectMethod *makeUniqueAnchorName* <tt>($web,$topic,$anchorName,$compatibility) -> $anchorName</tt>

   * =$anchorName= - the unprocessed anchor name
   * =$compatibilityMode= - SMELL: compatibility with *what*?? Who knows. :-(

Build a valid HTML anchor name (unique w.r.t. the list stored in %anchornames)



---++ ObjectMethod *internalLink* <tt>($theWeb,$theTopic,$theLinkText,$theAnchor,$doLink,$doKeepWeb,$hasExplicitLinkLabel,$theParams) -> $html</tt>

Generate a link.

Note: Topic names may be spaced out. Spaced out names are converted to <nop>WikWords,
for example, "spaced topic name" points to "SpacedTopicName".
   * =$theWeb= - the web containing the topic
   * =$theTopic= - the topic to be link
   * =$theLinkText= - text to use for the link
   * =$theAnchor= - the link anchor, if any
   * =$doLinkToMissingPages= - boolean: false means suppress link for non-existing pages
   * =$doKeepWeb= - boolean: true to keep web prefix (for non existing Web.TOPIC)
   * =$hasExplicitLinkLabel= - boolean: true in case of [[TopicName][explicit link label]]
   * =$theParams= - the URL parameters specified by ?name1=value1;name2=valu2;... excluding the leading ?.
     This is added as per Item7505. This parameter's natural position is before
     =$theAnchor=. But to minimize code changes, it's introduced as the laster
     one

Called by _handleWikiWord and _handleSquareBracketedLink and by Func::internalLink

Calls _renderWikiWord, which in turn will use Plurals.pm to match fold plurals to equivalency with their singular form

SMELL: why is this available to Func?



---++ ObjectMethod *renderFORM* <tt>(%params,$topic,$web) -> $tml</tt>

Returns TML of a TWiki Form, based on %FORM{}% variable.



---++ ObjectMethod *renderFORMFIELD* <tt>(%params,$topic,$web) -> $html</tt>

Returns the fully rendered expansion of a %FORMFIELD{}% tag.



---++ ObjectMethod *renderEDITFORM* <tt>(%params,$topic,$web) -> $tml</tt>

Returns TML of a TWiki Form, based on %EDITFORM{}% variable.



---++ ObjectMethod *renderEDITFORMFIELD* <tt>(%params,$topic,$web) -> $html</tt>

Returns the fully rendered expansion of a %EDITFORMFIELD{}% tag.



---++ ObjectMethod *getRenderedVersion* <tt>($text,$theWeb,$theTopic) -> $html</tt>

The main rendering function.



---++ StaticMethod *verbatimCallBack* <tt></tt>

Callback for use with putBackBlocks that replaces &lt; and >
by their HTML entities &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;



---++ ObjectMethod *TML2PlainText* <tt>($text,$web,$topic,$opts) -> $plainText</tt>

Clean up TWiki text for display as plain text without pushing it
through the full rendering pipeline. Intended for generation of
topic and change summaries. Adds nop tags to prevent TWiki
subsequent rendering; nops get removed at the very end.

Defuses TML.

$opts:
   * showvar - shows !%VAR% names if not expanded
   * expandvar - expands !%VARS%
   * nohead - strips ---+ headings at the top of the text
   * showmeta - does not filter meta-data
   * entityencode - entity encode the resulting plain text (for title parameter)



---++ ObjectMethod *protectPlainText* <tt>($text) -> $tml</tt>

Protect plain text from expansions that would normally be done
duing rendering, such as wikiwords. Topic summaries, for example,
have to be protected this way.



---++ ObjectMethod *makeTopicSummary* <tt>($theText,$theTopic,$theWeb,$theFlags) -> $tml</tt>

Makes a plain text summary of the given topic by simply trimming a bit
off the top. Truncates to $TMTRUNC chars or, if a number is specified in $theFlags,
to that length.



---++ ObjectMethod *takeOutBlocks* <tt>(\$text,$tag,\%map) -> $text</tt>

   * =$text= - Text to process
   * =$tag= - XHTML-style tag.
   * =\%map= - Reference to a hash to contain the removed blocks

Return value: $text with blocks removed

Searches through $text and extracts blocks delimited by a tag, appending each
onto the end of the @@buffer and replacing with a token
string which is not affected by TWiki rendering.  The text after these
substitutions is returned.

Parameters to the open tag are recorded.

This is _different_ to takeOutProtected, because it requires tags
to be on their own line. it also supports a callback for post-
processing the data before re-insertion.



---++ ObjectMethod *putBackBlocks* <tt>(\$text,\%map,$tag,$newtag,$callBack) -> $text</tt>

Return value: $text with blocks added back
   * =\$text= - reference to text to process
   * =\%map= - map placeholders to blocks removed by takeOutBlocks
   * =$tag= - Tag name processed by takeOutBlocks
   * =$newtag= - Tag name to use in output, in place of $tag. If undefined, uses $tag.
   * =$callback= - Reference to function to call on each block being inserted (optional)

Reverses the actions of takeOutBlocks.

Each replaced block is processed by the callback (if there is one) before
re-insertion.

Parameters to the outermost cut block are replaced into the open tag,
even if that tag is changed. This allows things like
&lt;verbatim class=''>
to be mapped to
&lt;pre class=''>

Cool, eh what? Jolly good show.

And if you set $newtag to '', we replace the taken out block with the valuse itself
   * which i'm using to stop the rendering process, but then at the end put in the html directly
   (for <literal> tag.



---++ ObjectMethod *renderRevisionInfo* <tt>($web,$topic,$meta,$rev,$format) -> $string</tt>

Obtain and render revision info for a topic.
   * =$web= - the web of the topic
   * =$topic= - the topic
   * =$meta= if specified, get rev info from here. If not specified, or meta contains rev info for a different version than the one requested, will reload the topic
   * =$rev= - the rev number, defaults to latest rev
   * =$format= - the render format, defaults to =$rev - $time - $wikiusername=
=$format= can contain the following keys for expansion:
   | =$web= | the web name |
   | =$topic= | the topic name |
   | =$rev= | the rev number |
   | =$comment= | the comment |
   | =$username= | the login of the saving user |
   | =$wikiname= | the wikiname of the saving user |
   | =$wikiusername= | the web.wikiname of the saving user |
   | =$date= | the date of the rev (no time) |
   | =$time= | the time of the rev |
   | =$min=, =$sec=, etc. | Same date format qualifiers as GMTIME |



---++ ObjectMethod *summariseChanges* <tt>($user,$web,$topic,$orev,$nrev,$tml) -> $text</tt>

   * =$user= - user (null to ignore permissions)
   * =$web= - web
   * =$topic= - topic
   * =$orev= - older rev
   * =$nrev= - later rev
   * =$tml= - if true will generate renderable TML (i.e. HTML with NOPs. if false will generate a summary suitable for use in plain text (mail, for example)
Generate a (max 3 line) summary of the differences between the revs.

If there is only one rev, a topic summary will be returned.

If =$tml= is not set, all HTML will be removed.

In non-tml, lines are truncated to 70 characters. Differences are shown using + and - to indicate added and removed text.



---++ ObjectMethod *forEachLine* <tt>($text,\&fn,\%options) -> $newText</tt>

Iterate over each line, calling =\&fn= on each.
\%options may contain:
   * =pre= => true, will call fn for each line in pre blocks
   * =verbatim= => true, will call fn for each line in verbatim blocks
   * =literal= => true, will call fn for each line in literal blocks
   * =noautolink= => true, will call fn for each line in =noautolink= blocks
The spec of \&fn is =sub fn( $line, \%options ) -> $newLine=. The %options
hash passed into this function is passed down to the sub, and the keys
=in_literal=, =in_pre=, =in_verbatim= and =in_noautolink= are set boolean
TRUE if the line is from one (or more) of those block types.

The return result replaces $line in $newText.



---++ StaticMethod *getReferenceRE* <tt>($web,$topic,%options) -> $re</tt>

   * $web, $topic - specify the topic being referred to, or web if $topic is
     undef.
   * %options - the following options are available
      * =interweb= - if true, then fully web-qualified references are required.
      * =grep= - if true, generate a GNU-grep compatible RE instead of the
        default Perl RE.
      * =url= - if set, generates an expression that will match a TWiki
        URL that points to the web/topic, instead of the default which
        matches topic links in plain text.
Generate a regular expression that can be used to match references to the
specified web/topic. Note that the resultant RE will only match fully
qualified (i.e. with web specifier) topic names and topic names that
are wikiwords in text. Works for spaced-out wikiwords for topic names.

The RE returned is designed to be used with =s///=



---++ StaticMethod *replaceTopicReferences* <tt>($text,\%options) -> $text</tt>

Callback designed for use with forEachLine, to replace topic references.
\%options contains:
   * =oldWeb= => Web of reference to replace
   * =oldTopic= => Topic of reference to replace
   * =newWeb= => Web of new reference
   * =newTopic= => Topic of new reference
   * =inWeb= => the web which the text we are presently processing resides in
   * =fullPaths= => optional, if set forces all links to full web.topic form
For a usage example see TWiki::UI::Manage.pm



---++ StaticMethod *replaceWebReferences* <tt>($text,\%options) -> $text</tt>

Callback designed for use with forEachLine, to replace web references.
\%options contains:
   * =oldWeb= => Web of reference to replace
   * =newWeb= => Web of new reference
For a usage example see TWiki::UI::Manage.pm



---++ ObjectMethod *replaceWebInternalReferences* <tt>(\$text,\%meta,$oldWeb,$oldTopic)</tt>

Change within-web wikiwords in $$text and $meta to full web.topic syntax.

\%options must include topics => list of topics that must have references
to them changed to include the web specifier.



---++ StaticMethod *breakName* <tt>($text,$args) -> $text</tt>

   * =$text= - text to "break"
   * =$args= - string of format (\d+)([,\s*]\.\.\.)?)
Hyphenates $text every $1 characters, or if $2 is "..." then shortens to
$1 characters and appends "..." (making the final string $1+3 characters
long)

_Moved from Search.pm because it was obviously unhappy there,
as it is a rendering function_



---++ StaticMethod *protectFormFieldValue* <tt>($value,$attrs) -> $html</tt>

Given the value of a form field, and a set of attributes that control how
to display that value, protect the value from further processing.

The protected value is determined from the value of the field after:
   * newlines are replaced with value of $attrs->{newline} if defined
   * processing through breakName if $attrs->{break} is defined
   * escaping of $vars if $attrs->{protectdollar} is defined
   * | is replaced with &amp;#124; or the value of $attrs->{bar} if defined

In addition to the name of a field =args= can be appended with a commas
followed by a string format (\d+)([,\s*]\.\.\.)?). This supports the formatted
search function $formfield and is used to shorten the returned string or a 
hyphenated string.
