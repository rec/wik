@---+ Package =TWiki::Configure::Checkers::CertificateChecker=
Configure GUI checker for Certificate items.

This checker validates files that contain X.509 certificates,
such as for the S/MIME signatures and for the Tasks framework.

It must be subclassed for the various certificate types, as the requirements
are slightly different.
