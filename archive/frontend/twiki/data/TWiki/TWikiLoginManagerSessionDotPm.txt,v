@---+ Package =TWiki::LoginManager::Session=

Class to provide CGI::Session like infra-structure, compatible with
TWiki Runtime Engine mechanisms other than CGI.

It inherits from CGI::Session and redefine methods that uses %ENV directly,
replacing by calls to TWiki::Request object, that is passed to constructor.

It also redefines =name= method, to avoid creating CGI object.
