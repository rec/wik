---+ Revision control

TWiki has "soft security" - anyone can change anything, but changes are logged. There is a complete audit trail:
   * Version
   * Date of last revision
   * Person who made change
is recorded. At the footer of each topic one can access previous versions, as well as differences between revisions by clicking on the <u>&gt;</u> sign located between revisions of a topic.
