@---+ Package =TWiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin=

This is login manager that you can specify in the security setup section of
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. It instructs TWiki to
cooperate with your web server (typically Apache) to require authentication
information (username & password) from users. It requires that you configure
your web server to demand authentication for scripts named "login" and anything
ending in "auth". The latter should be symlinks to existing scripts; e.g.,
=viewauth -> view=, =editauth -> edit=, and so on.

See also TWikiUserAuthentication.

Subclass of TWiki::LoginManager; see that class for documentation of the
methods of this class.


%TOC%

---++ ClassMethod *new* <tt>($session)</tt>

Construct the ApacheLogin object



---++ ObjectMethod *forceAuthentication* <tt>() -> boolean</tt>

method called when authentication is required - redirects to (...|view)auth
Triggered on auth fail



---++ ObjectMethod *loginUrl* <tt>() -> $loginUrl</tt>

TODO: why is this not used internally? When is it called, and why
Content of a login link



---++ ObjectMethod *login* <tt>($query,$twiki)</tt>

this allows the login and logon cgi-scripts to use the same code. 
all a logon does, is re-direct to viewauth, and apache then figures out 
if it needs to challenge the user



---++ ObjectMethod *getUser* <tt>() -> $authUser</tt>

returns the userLogin if stored in the apache CGI query (ie session)
