%X% This documentation is automatically generated from the =pod=, so it always matches the running code

%TOC%

---++ [[TWikiAccessControlExceptionDotPm][TWiki::AccessControlException]] 

Exception used raise an access control violation. This exception has the
following fields:
   * =web= - the web which was being accessed
   * =topic= - the topic being accessed (if any)
   * =user= - canonical username of the person doing the accessing. Use
   the methods of the TWiki::Users class to get more information about the
   user.
   * =mode= - the access mode e.g. CHANGE, VIEW etc
   * =reason= a text string giving the reason for the refusal.

The exception may be thrown by plugins. If a plugin throws the exception, it
will normally be caught and the browser redirected to a login screen (if the
user is not logged in) or reported (if they are and just don't have access).



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiAccessDotPm][TWiki::Access]] 

A singleton object of this class manages the access control database.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiAggregateIteratorDotPm][TWiki::AggregateIterator]] 

combine multiple iterators



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiAttachDotPm][TWiki::Attach]] 

A singleton object of this class is used to deal with attachments to topics.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiAttrsDotPm][TWiki::Attrs]] 

Class of attribute sets, designed for parsing and storing attribute values
from a TWiki tag e.g. =%<nop>TAG{"joe" fred="bad" joe="mad"}%=

An attribute set is a hash containing an entry for each parameter. The
default parameter (unnamed quoted string) is named <code>_<nop>DEFAULT</code> in the hash.

Attributes declared later in the string will override those of the same
name defined earlier. The one exception to this is the _DEFAULT key, where
the _first_ instance is always taken.

As well as the default TWiki syntax (parameter values double-quoted)
this class also parses single-quoted values, unquoted spaceless
values, spaces around the =, and commas as well as spaces separating values.
The extended syntax has to be enabled by passing the =$friendly= parameter
to =new=.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiCompatibilityDotPm][TWiki::Compatibility]] 

Support for compatibility with old TWiki versions. Packaged
separately because 99.999999% of the time this won't be needed.



This package has smell factor of *2*

---++ [[TWikiConfigureCheckersCertificateDotPm][TWiki::Configure::Checkers::CertificateChecker]] 
Configure GUI checker for Certificate items.

This checker validates files that contain X.509 certificates,
such as for the S/MIME signatures and for the Tasks framework.

It must be subclassed for the various certificate types, as the requirements
are slightly different.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiConfigureCheckersCertificateKeyCheckerDotPm][TWiki::Configure::Checkers::Certificate::KeyChecker]] 
Configure GUI checker for Certificate Key items.

This checker validates files that contain private key files
such as for the S/MIME signatures and for the Tasks framework.

It must be subclassed for the various certificate types, as the requirements
are slightly different.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiConfigureImgToolDotPm][TWiki::Configure::ImgTool]] 

This class is a singleton that offers URLs for the images (logos,
warning, info) used during configuration - when neither =pub= nor
=data= nor =template= directories are reliably available.

All the methods can be called either as class methods or as object
methods on the singleton:

   * Class method: %BR%
     $img = "=&lt;img src=" . TWiki::Configure::ImgTool->logo . "/&gt;"
   * Object method: %BR%
     my $imgtool = TWiki::Configure::ImgTool->instance;
     $img = "=&lt;img src=" . $imgtool->logo . "/&gt;"



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiConfigureLoadDotPm][TWiki::Configure::Load]] 

This module consists of just a single subroutine =readConfig=.  It allows to
safely modify configuration variables _for one single run_ without affecting
normal TWiki operation.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiConfigureUIsEXTENDDotPm][TWiki::Configure::UIs::EXTEND]] 



This package has smell factor of *2*

---++ [[TWikiDotPm][TWiki]] 

TWiki operates by creating a singleton object (known as the Session
object) that acts as a point of reference for all the different
modules in the system. This package is the class for this singleton,
and also contains the vast bulk of the basic constants and the per-
site configuration mechanisms.

Global variables are avoided wherever possible to avoid problems
with CGI accelerators such as mod_perl.

---+++!! Public Data members

   * moved: =loginManager=     TWiki::LoginManager singleton (moved to TWiki::Users)
   * =plugins=          TWiki::Plugins singleton
   * =prefs=            TWiki::Prefs singleton
   * =remoteUser=       Login ID when using ApacheLogin. Maintained for
                        compatibility only, do not use.

                        extracted from the URL path if {GetScriptUrlFromCgi}.
                        Only required to support {GetScriptUrlFromCgi} and
                        not consistently used. Avoid.
   * =security=         TWiki::Access singleton
   * =SESSION_TAGS=     Hash of TWiki variables whose value is specific to
                        the current request.
   * =store=            TWiki::Store singleton
   * =topicName=        Name of topic found in URL path or =topic= URL

   * =users=            TWiki::Users singleton
   * =webName=          Name of web found in URL path, or =web= URL parameter,
                        or {UsersWebName}



This package has smell factor of *37*

---++ [[TWikiEngineDotPm][TWiki::Engine]] 

The engine class is a singleton that implements details about TWiki's
execution mode. This is the base class and implements basic behavior.

Each engine should inherits from this and overload methods necessary
to achieve correct behavior.



This package has smell factor of *1*

---++ [[TWikiEngineExceptionDotPm][TWiki::EngineException]] 

Exception used to raise an engine related error. This exception has the
following fields:
   * =status= - status code to send to client
   * =reason= a text string giving the reason for the refusal.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiFormDotPm][TWiki::Form]] 

Object representing a single form definition.

Form definitions are mainly used to control rendering of a form for
editing, though there is some application login there that handles
transferring values between edits and saves.

A form definition consists of a TWiki::Form object, which has a list
of field definitions. Each field definition is an object of a type
derived from TWiki::Form::FieldDefinition. These objects are responsible
for the actual syntax and semantics of the field type. Form definitions
are parsed from TWiki tables, and the types are mapped by name to a
class declared in TWiki::Form::* - for example, the =text= type is mapped
to =TWiki::Form::Text= and the =checkbox= type to =TWiki::Form::Checkbox=.

The =TWiki::Form::FieldDefinition= class declares default behaviours for
types that accept a single value in their definitions. The
=TWiki::Form::ListFieldDefinition= extends this for types that have lists
of possible values.



This package has smell factor of *4*

---++ [[TWikiFormFieldDefinitionDotPm][TWiki::Form::FieldDefinition]] 

Base class of all field definition classes.

Type-specific classes are derived from this class to define specific
per-type behaviours. This class also provides default behaviours for when
a specific type cannot be loaded.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiFormListFieldDefinitionDotPm][TWiki::Form::ListFieldDefinition]] 
Form field definitions that accept lists of values in the field definition.
This is different to being multi-valued, which means the field type
can *store* multiple values.



This package has smell factor of *1*

---++ [[TWikiFormSelectDotPm][TWiki::Form::Select]] 



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiFuncDotPm][TWiki::Func]] 

<!-- STARTINCLUDE required for huge TWikiDocumentation topic -->
%STARTINCLUDE%

_Official list of stable TWiki functions for Plugin developers_

This module defines official functions that [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPlugins][TWiki plugins]]
can use to interact with the TWiki engine and content.

Refer to TWiki.EmptyPlugin and lib/TWiki/Plugins/EmptyPlugin.pm for a template
plugin and documentation on how to write a plugin.

Plugins should *only* use functions published in this module. If you use
functions in other TWiki libraries you might create a security hole and
you will probably need to change your plugin when you upgrade TWiki.

Deprecated functions will still work in older code, though they should
_not_ be called in new plugins and should be replaced in older plugins
as soon as possible.

The version of the TWiki::Func module is defined by the VERSION number of the
TWiki::Plugins module, currently %PLUGINVERSION%. This can be shown
by the =%<nop>PLUGINVERSION%= TWiki variable, and accessed in code using
=$TWiki::Plugins::VERSION=. The 'Since' field in the function
documentation refers to =$TWiki::Plugins::VERSION=.

Notes on use of =$TWiki::Plugins::VERSION= 6.00 and later:

   * The version number is now aligned with the TWiki release version.
   * A TWiki-6.7.8 release will have a =$TWiki::Plugins::VERSION = 6.78=.
   * In an unlikely case where the patch number is 10 or larger, the patch
     number is added to the previous patch number. For example, TWiki-6.7.9
     will have version =6.79=, TWiki-6.7.10 will have =6.7910=, and
     TWiki-6.7.11 will have =6.7911=. This ensures that the version number
     can sort properly.
   * =TWiki::Plugins::VERSION= also applies to the plugin handlers. The
     handlers are documented in the !EmptyPlugin, and that module indicates
     what version of =TWiki::Plugins::VERSION= it relates to.

A full history of the changes to this API can be found at the end of this
topic.



This package has smell factor of *1*

---++ [[TWikiI18NDotPm][TWiki::I18N]] 

Support for strings translation and language detection.

This package has smell factor of *1*

---++ [[TWikiIfNodeDotPm][TWiki::If::Node]] 

Node class for the result of an If statement parse



This package doesn't smell

it, but it may be useful.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiInfixParserDotPm][TWiki::Infix::Parser]] 

A simple stack-based parser that parses infix expressions with nonary,
unary and binary operators specified using an operator table.

Escapes are supported in strings, using backslash.

Iterator over the lines in a file



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiListIteratorDotPm][TWiki::ListIterator]] 

Iterator over a list



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiLoginManagerApacheLoginDotPm][TWiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin]] 

This is login manager that you can specify in the security setup section of
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. It instructs TWiki to
cooperate with your web server (typically Apache) to require authentication
information (username & password) from users. It requires that you configure
your web server to demand authentication for scripts named "login" and anything
ending in "auth". The latter should be symlinks to existing scripts; e.g.,
=viewauth -> view=, =editauth -> edit=, and so on.

See also TWikiUserAuthentication.

Subclass of TWiki::LoginManager; see that class for documentation of the
methods of this class.



This package has smell factor of *1*

---++ [[TWikiLoginManagerDotPm][TWiki::LoginManager]] 

The package is also a Factory for login managers and also the base class
for all login managers.

On its own, an object of this class is used when you specify 'none' in
the security setup section of
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. When it is used,
logins are not supported. If you want to authenticate users then you should
consider TemplateLogin or ApacheLogin, which are subclasses of this class.

If you are building a new login manager, then you should write a new subclass
of this class, implementing the methods marked as *VIRTUAL*. There are already
examples in the =lib/TWiki/LoginManager= directory.

The class has extensive tracing, which is enabled by
$TWiki::cfg{Trace}{LoginManager.pm}. The tracing is done in such a way as to
let the perl optimiser optimise out the trace function as a no-op if tracing
is disabled.

Here's an overview of how it works:

Early in TWiki::new, the login manager is created. The creation of the login 
manager does two things:
   1. If sessions are in use, it loads CGI::Session but doesn't initialise the
      session yet.
   2. Creates the login manager object

Slightly later in TWiki::new, loginManager->loadSession is called.
   1. Calls loginManager->getUser to get the username *before* the session is created
      * TWiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin looks at REMOTE_USER (only for authenticated scripts)
      * TWiki::LoginManager::TemplateLogin just returns undef
   2. reads the TWIKISID cookie to get the SID (or the TWIKISID parameters in
      the CGI query if cookies aren't available, or IP2SID mapping if that's enabled).
   3. Creates the CGI::Session object, and the session is thereby read.
   4. If the username still isn't known, reads it from the cookie. Thus
      TWiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin overrides the cookie using REMOTE_USER, and
      TWiki::LoginManager::TemplateLogin *always* uses the session.

Later again in TWiki::new, plugins are given a chance to *override* the username 
found from the loginManager.

The last step in TWiki::new is to find the user, using whatever user mapping 
manager is in place.



This package has smell factor of *8*

---++ [[TWikiLoginManagerSessionDotPm][TWiki::LoginManager::Session]] 

Class to provide CGI::Session like infra-structure, compatible with
TWiki Runtime Engine mechanisms other than CGI.

It inherits from CGI::Session and redefine methods that uses %ENV directly,
replacing by calls to TWiki::Request object, that is passed to constructor.

It also redefines =name= method, to avoid creating CGI object.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiLoginManagerTemplateLoginDotPm][TWiki::LoginManager::TemplateLogin]] 

This is a login manager that you can specify in the security setup section of
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. It provides users with a
template-based form to enter usernames and passwords, and works with the
PasswordManager that you specify to verify those passwords.

Subclass of TWiki::LoginManager; see that class for documentation of the
methods of this class.



This package has smell factor of *2*

---++ [[TWikiMdrepoDotPm][TWiki::Mdrepo]] 



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiMergeDotPm][TWiki::Merge]] 

Support for merging strings



This package has smell factor of *1*

---++ [[TWikiMetaDotPm][TWiki::Meta]] 

All TWiki topics have *data* (text) and *meta-data* (information about the
topic). Meta-data includes information such as file attachments, form fields,
topic parentage etc. When TWiki loads a topic from the store, it represents
the meta-data in the topic using an object of this class.

A meta-data object is a hash of different types of meta-data (keyed on
the type, such as 'FIELD' and 'TOPICINFO').

Each entry in the hash is an array, where each entry in the array
contains another hash of the key=value pairs, corresponding to a
single meta-datum.

If there may be multiple entries of the same top-level type (i.e. for FIELD
and FILEATTACHMENT) then the array has multiple entries. These types
are referred to as "keyed" types. The array entries are keyed with the
attribute 'name' which must be in each entry in the array.

For unkeyed types, the array has only one entry.

Pictorially,
   * TOPICINFO
      * author => '...'
      * date => '...'
      * ...
   * FILEATTACHMENT
      * [0] -> { name => '...' ... }
      * [1] -> { name => '...' ... }
   * FIELD
      * [0] -> { name => '...' ... }
      * [1] -> { name => '...' ... }

As well as the meta-data, the object also stores the web name, topic
name and remaining text after meta-data extraction.



This package has smell factor of *2*

---++ [[TWikiNetDotPm][TWiki::Net]] 

Object that brokers access to network resources.



This package has smell factor of *4*

---++ [[TWikiNetHTTPResponseDotPm][TWiki::Net::HTTPResponse]] 

Fakeup of HTTP::Response for use when LWP is not available. Only implements
a small subset of the HTTP::Response methods:
| =code()= |
| =message()= |
| =header($field)= |
| =content()= |
| =is_error()= |
| =is_redirect()= |

See the documentation of HTTP::Response for information about the methods.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiOopsExceptionDotPm][TWiki::OopsException]] 

Exception used to raise a request to redirect to an Oops URL.

An OopsException thrown anywhere in the code will redirect the
browser to a url based on the =oops= script. =oops= requires
the name of an oops template file from the =templates= directory.
This file will be expanded and the
parameter values passed to the exception instantiated. The
result will be shown in the browser.

Plugins may throw TWiki::OopsException. For example:

<verbatim>
use Error;

...

throw TWiki::OopsException( 'bathplugin',
                            def => 'toestuck',
                            web => $web,
                            topic => $topic,
                            params => [ 'bigtoe', 'hot tap' ] );

</verbatim>

---++ [[TWikiPluginDotPm][TWiki::Plugin]] 



This package has smell factor of *2*

---++ [[TWikiPluginsDotPm][TWiki::Plugins]] 

This module defines the singleton object that handles Plugins
loading, initialization and execution.

This class uses Chain of Responsibility (GOF) pattern to dispatch
handler calls to registered plugins.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiPluralsDotPm][TWiki::Plurals]] 

Handle conversion of plural topic names to singular form.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiPrefsDotPm][TWiki::Prefs]] 

The Prefs class is a singleton that implements management of preferences.
It uses a stack of TWiki::Prefs::PrefsCache objects to store the
preferences for global, web, user and topic contexts, and provides
the means to look up preferences in these.

Preferences from different places stack on top of each other, so there
are global preferences, then site, then web (and subweb and subsubweb),
then topic, included topic and so on. Each level of the stack is tagged with
a type identifier.

The module also maintains a separate of the preferences found in every topic
and web it reads. This supports the lookup of preferences for webs and topics
that are not on the stack, and must not be chained in (you can't allow
a user to override protections from their home topic!)



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiPrefsParserDotPm][TWiki::Prefs::Parser]] 

This Prefs-internal class is used to parse * Set and * Local statements
from arbitrary text, and extract settings from meta objects.  It is used
by TopicPrefs to parse preference settings from topics.

This class does no validation or duplicate-checking on the settings; it
simply returns the recognized settings in the order it sees them in.



This package has smell factor of *1*

---++ [[TWikiPrefsPrefsCacheDotPm][TWiki::Prefs::PrefsCache]] 

The PrefsCache package holds a cache of topics that have been read in, using
the TopicPrefs class.  These functions manage that cache.

We maintain 2 hashes of values:
   * {locals} Contains all locals at this level. Locals are values that
     only apply when the current topic is the topic where the local is
     defined. The variable names are decorated with the locality where
     they apply.
   * {values} contains all sets, locals, and all values inherited from
     the parent level

As each cache level is built, the values are copied down from the parent
cache level. This sounds monstrously inefficient, but in fact perl does
this a lot better than doing a multi-level lookup when a value is referenced.
This is especially important when many prefs lookups may be done in a
session, for example when searching.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiQueryHoistREsDotPm][TWiki::Query::HoistREs]] 

Static functions to extract regular expressions from queries. The REs can
be used in caching stores that use the TWiki standard inline meta-data
representation to pre-filter topic lists for more efficient query matching.

See =Store/RcsFile.pm= for an example of usage.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiQueryNodeDotPm][TWiki::Query]] 

A Query object is a representation of a query over the TWiki database.

Fields are given by name, and values by strings or numbers. Strings should always be surrounded by 'single-quotes'. Numbers can be signed integers or decimals. Single quotes in values may be escaped using backslash (\).

See TWiki.QuerySearch for details of the query language. At the time of writing
only a subset of the entire query language is supported, for use in searching.

A query object implements the =evaluate= method as its general
contract with the rest of the world. This method does a "hard work" evaluation
of the parser tree. Of course, smarter Store implementations should be
able to do it better....



This package has smell factor of *2*

---++ [[TWikiQueryParserDotPm][TWiki::Query::Parser]] 

Parser for queries



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiRenderDotPm][TWiki::Render]] 

This module provides most of the actual HTML rendering code in TWiki.



This package has smell factor of *21*

---++ [[TWikiRequestDotPm][TWiki::Request]] 

Class to encapsulate request data.

Fields:
   * =action= action requested (view, edit, save, ...)
   * =cookies= hashref whose keys are cookie names and values
               are CGI::Cookie objects
   * =headers= hashref whose keys are header name
   * =request_method= request method (GET, HEAD, POST)
   * =param= hashref of parameters, both query and body ones
   * =param_list= arrayref with parameter names in received order
   * =path_info= path_info of request (eg. /WebName/TopciName)
   * =remote_address= Client's IP address
   * =remote_user= Remote HTTP authenticated user
   * =secure= Boolean value about use of encryption
   * =server_port= Port that the webserver listens on

---++ [[TWikiSandboxDotPm][TWiki::Sandbox]] 

This object provides an interface to the outside world. All calls to
system functions, or handling of file names, should be brokered by
this object.

NOTE: TWiki creates a singleton sandbox that is *shared* by all TWiki
runs under a single mod_perl instance. If any TWiki run modifies the
sandbox, that modification will carry over in to subsequent runs.
Be very, very careful!

This package has smell factor of *12*

---++ [[TWikiStoreDotPm][TWiki::Store]] 

This module hosts the generic storage backend. This module provides
the interface layer between the "real" store provider - which is hidden
behind a handler - and the rest of the system. it is responsible for
checking for topic existance, access permissions, and all the other
general admin tasks that are common to all store implementations.

This module knows nothing about how the data is actually _stored_ -
that knowledge is entirely encapsulated in the handlers.

The general contract for methods in the class requires that errors
are signalled using exceptions. TWiki::AccessControlException is
used for access control exceptions, and Error::Simple for all other
types of error.

---++ [[TWikiStoreQueryAlgorithmsBruteForceDotPm][TWiki::Store::QueryAlgorithms::BruteForce]] 

Default brute-force query algorithm

Has some basic optimisation: it hoists regular expressions out of the
query to use with grep, so we can narrow down the set of topics that we
have to evaluate the query on.

Not sure exactly where the breakpoint is between the
costs of hoisting and the advantages of hoisting. Benchmarks suggest
that it's around 6 topics, though this may vary depending on disk
speed and memory size. It also depends on the complexity of the query.

---++ [[TWikiStoreRcsFileDotPm][TWiki::Store::RcsFile]] 

This class is PACKAGE PRIVATE to Store, and should never be
used from anywhere else. It is the base class of implementations of stores
that manipulate RCS format files.

The general contract of the methods on this class and its subclasses
calls for errors to be signalled by Error::Simple exceptions.

Refer to Store.pm for models of usage.

Simple replacement for RCS.  Doesn't support:
   * branches
   * locking
Neither of which are used (or needed) by TWiki.

This module doesn't know anything about the content of the topic

There is one of these object for each file stored under RCSLite.

This object is PACKAGE PRIVATE to Store, and should NEVER be
used from anywhere else.

FIXME:
   * need to tidy up dealing with \n for differences
   * still have difficulty on line ending at end of sequences, consequence of doing a line based diff

Identifiers are case sensitive. Keywords are in lower case only. The
sets of keywords and identifiers can overlap. In most environments RCS
uses the ISO 8859/1 encoding: visible graphic characters are codes
041-176 and 240-377, and white space characters are codes 010-015 and 040.

Dates, which appear after the date keyword, are of the form Y.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss,
where Y is the year, mm the month (01-12), dd the day (01-31), hh the hour
(00-23), mm the minute (00-59), and ss the second (00-60). Y contains just
the last two digits of the year for years from 1900 through 1999, and all
the digits of years thereafter. Dates use the Gregorian calendar; times
use UTC.

The newphrase productions in the grammar are reserved for future extensions
to the format of RCS files. No newphrase will begin with any keyword already
in use.

Revisions consist of a sequence of 'a' and 'd' edits that need to be
applied to rev N+1 to get rev N. Each edit has an offset (number of lines
from start) and length (number of lines). For 'a', the edit is followed by
length lines (the lines to be inserted in the text). For example:

d1 3     means "delete three lines starting with line 1
a4 2     means "insert two lines at line 4'
xxxxxx   is the new line 4
yyyyyy   is the new line 5

---++ [[TWikiUserMappingDotPm][TWiki::UserMapping]] 

This is a virtual base class (a.k.a an interface) for all user mappers. It is
*not* useable as a mapping in TWiki - use the BaseUserMapping for default
behaviour.

User mapping is the process by which TWiki maps from a username (a login name)
to a display name and back. It is also where groups are maintained.

See TWiki::Users::BaseUserMapping and TWiki::Users::TWikiUserMapping for
the default implementations of this interface.

If you want to write a user mapper, you will need to implement the methods
described in this class.

User mappings work by mapping both login names and display names to a
_canonical user id_. This user id is composed from a prefix that defines
the mapper in use (something like 'BaseUserMapping_' or 'LdapUserMapping_')
and a unique user id that the mapper uses to identify the user.

The null prefix is reserver for the TWikiUserMapping for compatibility
with old TWiki releases.

__Note:__ in all the following documentation, =$cUID= refers to a
*canonical user id*.

---++ [[TWikiUsersBaseUserMappingDotPm][TWiki::Users::BaseUserMapping]] 

User mapping is the process by which TWiki maps from a username (a login name)

---++ [[TWikiUsersDotPm][TWiki::Users]] 
This package provides services for the lookup and manipulation of login and
wiki names of users, and their authentication.

It is a Facade that presents a common interface to the User Mapping
and Password modules. The rest of the core should *only* use the methods
of this package, and should *never* call the mapping or password managers
directly.

TWiki uses the concept of a _login name_ which is used to authenticate a
user. A login name maps to a _wiki name_ that is used to identify the user
for display. Each login name is unique to a single user, though several
login names may map to the same wiki name.

Using this module (and the associated plug-in user mapper) TWiki supports
the concept of _groups_. Groups are sets of login names that are treated
equally for the purposes of access control. Group names do not have to be
wiki names, though it is helpful for display if they are.

Internally in the code TWiki uses something referred to as a _canonical user
id_ or just _user id_. The user id is also used externally to uniquely identify
the user when (for example) recording topic histories. The user id is *usually*
just the login name, but it doesn't need to be. It just has to be a unique
7-bit alphanumeric and underscore string that can be mapped to/from login
and wiki names by the user mapper.

The canonical user id should *never* be seen by a user. On the other hand,
core code should never use anything *but* a canonical user id to refer
to a user.

*Terminology*
   * A *login name* is the name used to log in to TWiki. Each login name is
     assumed to be unique to a human. The Password module is responsible for
     authenticating and manipulating login names.
   * A *canonical user id* is an internal TWiki representation of a user. Each
     canonical user id maps 1:1 to a login name.
   * A *wikiname* is how a user is displayed. Many user ids may map to a
     single wikiname. The user mapping module is responsible for mapping
     the user id to a wikiname.
   * A *group id* represents a group of users and other groups.
     The user mapping module is responsible for mapping from a group id to
     a list of canonical user ids for the users in that group.
   * An *email* is an email address asscoiated with a *login name*. A single
     login name may have many emails.
	 
*NOTE:* 
   * wherever the code references $cUID, its a canonical_id
   * wherever the code references $group, its a group_name
   * $name may be a group or a cUID

---++ [[TWikiUsersHtPasswdUserDotPm][TWiki::Users::HtPasswdUser]] 

Support for htpasswd and htdigest format password files.

See documentation of that class for descriptions of the methods of this class.



This package has smell factor of *3*

---++ [[TWikiUsersPasswordDotPm][TWiki::Users::Password]] 

Base class of all password handlers. Default behaviour is no passwords,
so anyone can be anyone they like.

The methods of this class should be overridded by subclasses that want
to implement other password handling methods.



This package doesn't smell

---++ [[TWikiUsersTWikiUserMappingDotPm][TWiki::Users::TWikiUserMapping]] 

The User mapping is the process by which TWiki maps from a username (a login name)
to a wikiname and back. It is also where groups are defined.

By default TWiki maintains user topics and group topics in the %USERSWEB% that
define users and group. These topics are
   * !TWikiUsers - stores a mapping from usernames to TWiki names
   * !WikiName - for each user, stores info about the user
   * !GroupNameGroup - for each group, a topic ending with "Group" stores a list of users who are part of that group.

Many sites will want to override this behaviour, for example to get users and groups from a corporate database.

This class implements the basic TWiki behaviour using topics to store users,
but is also designed to be subclassed so that other services can be used.

Subclasses should be named 'XxxxUserMapping' so that configure can find them.

---++ [[MonitorDotPm][Monitor]] 

Monitoring package. Instrument the code like this:

use Monitor;
Monitor::MARK("Description of event");
Monitor::MARK("Another event");

or, to monitor all the calls to a module

use Monitor;
Monitor::MonitorMethod('TWiki::Users');

or a function

use Monitor;
Monitor::MonitorMethod('TWiki::Users', 'getCanonicalUserID');

Then set the environment variable TWIKI_MONITOR to a perl true value, and
run the script from the command line e.g:
$ cd bin
$ ./view -topic Myweb/MyTestTopic

The results will be printed to STDERR at the end of the run. Two times are
shown, a time relative to the last MARK and a time relative to the first MARK
(which is always set the first time this package is used). The final column
is total memory.

NOTE: it uses /proc - so its linux specific...

d306 7
a312 15
   * If the *major* version (e.g. =1.=) is the same then any plugin coded
     to use any *earlier* revision of the =1.= API will still work. No
     function has been removed from the interface, nor has any API published
     in that version changed in such a way as to *require* plugins to be
     recoded.
   * If the *minor* version (e.g. 1.1) is incremented there may be changes
     in the API that may help improve the coding of some plugins - for
     example, new interfaces giving access to previously hidden core functions.
     In addition, *deprecation* of functions in the interface trigger a minor
     version increment. Note that deprecated functions are not _removed_, they
     are merely frozen, and plugin authors are recommended to stop using them.
   * Any additional digits in the version number relate to minor changes, such
     as the addition of parameters to the existing functions, or addition of
     utility functions that are unlikely to require significant changes to
     existing plugins.

Early in TWiki::new, the login manager is created. The creation of the login manager does two things:
   1 If sessions are in use, it loads CGI::Session but doesn't initialise the session yet.
   1 Creates the login manager object
d484 1
a484 1
   1 Calls loginManager->getUser to get the username *before* the session is created
d487 6
a492 3
   1 reads the TWIKISID cookie to get the SID (or the TWIKISID parameters in the CGI query if cookies aren't available, or IP2SID mapping if that's enabled).
   1 Creates the CGI::Session object, and the session is thereby read.
   1 If the username still isn't known, reads it from the cookie. Thus TWiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin overrides the cookie using REMOTE_USER, and TWiki::LoginManager::TemplateLogin *always* uses the session.

Later again in TWiki::new, plugins are given a chance to *override* the username found from the loginManager.

Class of attribute sets, designed for parsing and storing attribute values
from a TWiki tag e.g. =%TAG{fred='bad' "sad" joe="mad"}%=
d80 1
a80 2
An attribute set is a map containing an entry for each parameter. The
default parameter (unnamed quoted string) is named <code>_<nop>DEFAULT</code> in the map.
d82 1
a82 3
Attributes declared later in the string will override those of the same
name defined earlier. The one exception to this is the _DEFAULT key, where
the _first_ instance of a setting is always taken.
a83 6
As well as standard TWiki syntax (parameter values double-quoted)
it also parses single-quoted values, unquoted spaceless
values, spaces around the =, and commas as well as spaces separating values,
though none of these alternatives is advertised in documentation and
the extended syntax can be turned off by passing the 'strict' parameter
to =new=.

This is login manager that you can specify in the security setup section of
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. It instructs TWiki to
cooperate with your web server (typically Apache) to require authentication
information (username & password) from users. It requires that you configure
your web server to demand authentication for scripts named "login" and anything
ending in "auth". The latter should be symlinks to existing scripts; e.g.,
=viewauth -> view=, =editauth -> edit=, and so on.

a125 5
On it's own, an object of this class is used when you specify 'none' in
the security setup section of
[[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. When it is used,
logins are not supported. If you want to authenticate users then you should
consider TemplateLogin or ApacheLogin, which are subclasses of this class.
d127 1
a127 3
If you are building a new login manager, then you should write a new subclass
of this class, implementing the methods marked as *VIRTUAL*. There are already
examples in the =lib/TWiki/Client= directory.
a128 4
The class has extensive tracing, which is enabled by
$TWiki::cfg{Trace}{Client.pm}. The tracing is done in such a way as to
let the perl optimiser optimise out the trace function as a no-op if tracing
is disabled.

Here's an overview of how it works:
d131 1
a131 10
Early in TWiki::new, the login manager is created. The creation of the login manager does two things:
   1 If sessions are in use, it loads CGI::Session but doesn't initialise the session yet.
   1 Creates the login manager object
Slightly later in TWiki::new, loginManager->loadSession is called.
   1 Calls loginManager->getUser to get the username *before* the session is created
      * TWiki::Client::ApacheLogin looks at REMOTE_USER
      * TWiki::Client::TemplateLogin just returns undef
   1 reads the TWIKISID cookie to get the SID (or the TWIKISID parameters in the CGI query if cookies aren't available, or IP2SID mapping if that's enabled).
   1 Creates the CGI::Session object, and the session is thereby read.
   1 If the username still isn't known, reads it from the cookie. Thus TWiki::Client::ApacheLogin overrides the cookie using REMOTE_USER, and TWiki::Client::TemplateLogin *always* uses the session.
d133 1
a133 1
Later again in TWiki::new, plugins are given a chance to *override* the username found from the loginManager.
d135 1
a135 1
The last step in TWiki::new is to find the user, using whatever user mapping manager is in place.

This module defines official functions that [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPlugins][Plugins]]
d305 25
a329 22
by the =%<nop>PLUGINVERSION%= variable. The 'Since' field in the function
documentation refers to the VERSION number and the date that the function
was addded.

__Note:__ Beware! These methods should only ever be called
from the context of a TWiki Plugin. They require a Plugins SESSION context to be
established before they are called, and will not work if simply called from
another TWiki module. For example,
<verbatim>
use TWiki;
print TWiki::Func::getSkin(),"\n";
</verbatim>
will fail with =Can't call method "getSkin" on an undefined value at TWiki/Func.pm line 83=.

If you want to call the methods outside the context of a plugin, you can create a Plugins SESSION object. For example,
the script:
<verbatim>
use TWiki:
$TWiki::Plugins::SESSION = new TWiki();
print TWiki::Func::getSkin(),"\n";
</verbatim>
will work happily.

User mapping is the process by which TWiki maps from a username (a login name) to a wikiname and back. It is also
where groups are maintained.
d1141 2
a1142 5
By default TWiki maintains user topics and group topics in the %MAINWEB% that
define users and group. These topics are
   * !TWikiUsers - stores a mapping from usernames to TWiki names
   * !WikiName - for each user, stores info about the user
   * !GroupNameGroup - for each group, a topic ending with "Group" stores a list of users who are part of that group.
a1143 1
Many sites will want to override this behaviour, for example to get users and groups from a corporate database.
a1144 2
This class implements the basic TWiki behaviour using topics to store users, but is also designed to be subclassed
so that other services can be used.
d1146 1
a1146 7
Subclasses should be named 'XxxxUserMapping' so that configure can find them.

*All* methods in this class should be implemented by subclasses.
