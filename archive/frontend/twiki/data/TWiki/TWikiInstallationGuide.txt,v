---+ TWiki Installation Guide

*The following is installation instructions for the TWiki-6.1 production release on an Apache web server on Linux.* Visit TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki for the latest updates to this guide and supplemental information for installing or upgrading TWiki, including notes on installing TWiki on different platforms, environments and web hosting sites.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of TWiki, you probably want to read TWikiUpgradeGuide instead.

%TOC%

---++ Preparing to install TWiki

Before attempting to install TWiki, you are encouraged to review the AdminSkillsAssumptions. This guide assumes you have, at a minimum, basic knowledge of server administration on the system on which TWiki is to be installed. While it is possible to install TWiki with FTP access alone (for example, on a hosted site), it is tricky and may require additional support from your hosting service (for example, in setting file ownership and installing missing Perl CPAN libraries).

To help setup a correct Apache configuration, you are very much encouraged to use the automatic tool TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator which generates the contents for an Apache config file for TWiki based on your inputs.

While this installation guide specifically describes installation on an Apache web server on Linux, TWiki should work fine with any web server and OS that meet the system requirements (see below). For additional notes on installing TWiki on other systems, see TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki#OtherPlatforms.

If you are installing TWiki without Unix/Linux root (administrator) privileges (for example, on a hosted domain), see "Notes on Installing TWiki on Non-Root Account" below for supplemental instructions to the basic steps presented below.

If you are upgrading from an earlier major version of TWiki such as Cairo (TWiki-3) or TWiki 4.x you will need the information found at TWikiUpgradeGuide.

One of the more difficult tasks is installation of additional !CPAN libraries. See TWiki:TWiki.HowToInstallCpanModules for detailed information on how to install !CPAN libraries.

If you need help, ask a question in the TWiki:Support.WebHome web or on TWiki:Codev.TWikiIRC (irc.freenode.net, channel #twiki).

#StandardInstallation
---++ Basic Installation

   1 *Download* the TWiki distribution from http://TWiki.org/. (Example - download =TWiki-6.1.0.tgz= for Linux)
   1  Copy the downloaded package into the directory where you want to install TWiki (Example: =/var/www=). *Unpack the distribution* in it (Example: =tar xvfz TWiki-6.1.0.tgz=). The unpack will create a directory called ==twiki== which contains the TWiki package. In the rest of this document we assume this directory is called =twiki=.
      * __Note:__ TWiki does not allow spaces in directory names. Especially on Windows make sure to use a directory path without spaces.
   1 *Setup access file and directory rights* to enable the webserver user (the user Apache runs the CGI scripts as) to read and write inside the twiki directory.
      * __Warning:__ Do not just run a =chmod -R 770 twiki=. The access rules have different meaning for files and directories. This is the most common mistake installers make.
      * The distribution tgz has the file and directory access rights setup to work with a reasonable security level that will work for all types of installations including shared hosting.
      * The ownership of the twiki directory tree is normally set to the user that unpacked the tgz and will have to be changed to the webserver user using the command =chown -R user:group /path/to/twiki=. The webserver username varies from Distributions. Examples for some major distributions:
         * !RedHat, Fedora, !CentOS, Gentoo, Mandriva : =chown -R apache:apache /path/to/twiki=
         * debian/Ubuntu/Kubunto : =chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/twiki=
         * Suse : =chown -R wwwrun:www /path/to/twiki=
      * If you mistakenly change the access rights in a way that makes TWiki stop working, simply run the script found at TWiki:TWiki.SettingFileAccessRightsLinuxUnix to set the access rights of the entire TWiki tree back to the defaults in the distribution. 
      * It is possible to define tighter access rules than the ones given by default after the installation is complete. But how tight they should be depends on your distribution and local needs. Typically you may want to limit all access from world if the webserver machine has login access for other users than root and the web server administrator. For a dedicated web server made just for running TWiki with limited login access the default access rights are reasonable.
   1 *Check the Perl installation and CPAN dependencies*. Ensure that Perl 5 is installed on your system.
      * The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. *If it's somewhere else*, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory.
      * Check if required modules listed in TWikiSystemRequirements are present; install modules as needed.  If needed, [[TWiki:TWiki/HowToInstallCpanModules][learn how to install CPAN modules]].
      * Some systems require a special extension on perl scripts (e.g. =.cgi= or =.pl=). This is normally only needed under Windows and only where perl scripts are only recognized by file extension. Linux and Unix users should normally never need to do this. If necessary, rename all files in =twiki/bin=  (i.e. rename =view= to =view.pl= etc). If you do this, make sure you set the =ScriptSuffix= option in =configure= (Step 6).
   1 *Create the file !LocalLib.cfg* located as =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=
      * There is a template for this file in =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt=. Simply copy !LocalLib.cfg.txt to !LocalLib.cfg. Make sure the ownership and access rights of the copy are the same as !LocalLib.cfg.txt
      * The file =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg= must contain a setting for =$twikiLibPath=, which must point to the absolute directory path of your =twiki/lib= e.g. =/var/www/twiki/lib=.
      * If you need to install additional [[http://cpan.perl.org/][CPAN]] modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server, you can set =$CPANBASE= to point to your personal [[http://cpan.perl.org/][CPAN]] install. Don't forget that the webserver user has to be able to read those files as well.
   1 *Choose best configuration method* for your webserver. There are two ways to configure Apache: config file included from httpd.conf or .htaccess files.
      * Apache config file: The recommended method is using a config file. With a config file you can put the entire TWiki configuration in ONE file (typically named =twiki.conf=). Performance is much better with a config file, and makes setting up a correct and safe installation easier. However using a config file requires that you can restart Apache which again means that you need root or sudo access to stop and start Apache. The TWiki apache config file is included from the main Apache config file httpd.conf. Most distributions have a directory from which any file that ends with =.conf= gets included when you restart Apache (Example !RedHat/Fedora/Centos: =/etc/httpd/conf.d=). If you use a virtual host setup in Apache you should include the twiki.conf file from inside the desired virtual host config in your Apache configuration.
      * .htaccess files: This option should only be used when you cannot use a config file. Performance is slowed down because Apache has to look through all directories in search of possible .htaccess files each time someone views a page in TWiki. Normally this is the only way to control Apache in a shared host environment where you have no root or sudo privileges.
   1 *Configure the webserver*
       * Make sure that Apache is configured to run CGI scripts. On Debian and Ubuntu, enter (with root privileges) =a2enmod cgi=. If the system may suggest =cgid= instead of =cgi=, either one is fine.
      * Unless you are an Apache expert setting up the webserver can be quite difficult. But TWiki has three resources that make setting up Apache easier.
         * The best and easiest way is to use webpage TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator which contains a tool that can generate a safe and working config file for TWiki on Apache.
         * In the twiki installation you find an example config file =misc/twiki_httpd_conf.txt= (nevertheless, it is better to use the generator).
      * In case you do not have root privileges on the server:
         * In the root of the twiki installation and in the =twiki/bin= directory you find example =.htaccess= files you can copy and modify. The files contains help text explaining how to set them up. In =twiki/bin= you find =.htaccess.txt= which can be copied to =.htaccess= and defined access to the CGI scripts.
         * In the TWiki =misc= directory you find =pub-htaccess.txt= which you can copy to =pub/.htaccess=, =subdir-htaccess.txt= which you can copy to all directories as =.htaccess= except bin and pub, and you find =root-htaccess.txt= which you can copy to =.htaccess= in the twiki root directory. But again only use .htaccess files if you do not have root privileges.
      * If you are unsure about how to do this on your system, see TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki#OtherPlatforms for links to information about various server setups.
      * __Note:__ When you use config files you need to restart Apache each time you change a setting to make the new setting active.
   1 *Run the =configure= script* from your browser (enter =http://yourdomain/do/configure= into your browser address bar)
      * Specify and reenter a password. This is your configure password, as well as the =admin= user password once TWiki is running.
         * __Note:__ In case you forgot the password, you can reset it by deleting ==$TWiki::cfg{Password}== from ==LocalSite.cfg== file from =={TWIKI_ROOT}/lib== directory.
      * When you run =configure= for the first time, you can only edit the =General Path Settings= section. Save these settings, and then return to =configure= to continue configuration.
      * Resolve any errors or warnings it tells you about.
      * If your webserver can be accessed by more than one domain name make sure to add the additional alternative URLs to ={PermittedRedirectHostUrls}=
      * When you return to configure you now need to setup _Mail and Proxies_. Especially the ={WebMasterEmail}=, and ={SMTP}{MAILHOST}= must be defined to enable TWiki to send administrative emails, such as for registration and notification of topic changes. Many ISPs have introduced authentication when sending emails to fight spam so you may also have to set ={SMTP}{Username}= and ={SMTP}{Password}=. If you do not want to enable mailing or want to enable it later you can uncheck ={EnableEmail}=.
      * If you want administrative e-mails to be signed, see [[#SmimeSetup][S/MIME setup instructions below]].

You now have a basic, unauthenticated installation running. At this point you can just point your web browser at =http://yourdomain.com/do/view= and start TWiki-ing away!

#SecuritySettings
---++ Important Server Security Settings

Before you continue any further there are some basic and very important security settings you have to make sure are set correctly.

   1. You absolutely must turn off any kind of PHP, Perl, Python, Server Side Includes etc in the =pub= directory. TWiki has some built-in protection which renames files with dangerous file names by appending .txt to the file name. But this is a secondary security measure. The essential action that you must take is to turn off any possible execution of any of the attached files.<br /> Most Linux distributions have a default Apache installation which has PHP and server side include (SSI) enabled.
   1. Don't put the whole twiki distribution into an HTML document enabled directory. Apache needs to be aware of only two directories: The =bin= directory should be script enabled, and the =pub= directory should be HTML document enabled.
     <br /> For those who do not have access to the Apache config files, a sample =misc/subdir-htaccess.txt= file can be copied as =.htaccess= to the data, lib, locale, templates, tools and working directories.
   1. Attachments are not secured by default to the access control setting of the topic. In other words, anyone can read them if they know the direct URL of the attachment, which includes name of the web, topic and attachment. You can [[TWikiAccessControl#SecuringAttachments][configure TWiki to secure attachments]].

The TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator as well as the example =misc/twiki_httpd_conf.txt= and example =misc/htaccess.txt= files include the needed settings that protect against all 3 security elements.

---++ Next Steps

Once you have TWiki installed and running, you might consider the following optional steps for setting up and customizing your TWiki site. Many of the references below refer to topics within your TWiki installation. For example, =TWiki.TWikiSkins= refers to the =TWikiSkins= topic in your TWiki web. Easy way to jump directly to view the pages is to open your own TWiki in your browser and write =TWiki.TWikiSkins= in the Jump test box to the right in the top bar and hit Enter. You can find these topics in the on-line reference copy at the official TWiki website: [[TWiki:TWiki06x01.WebHome][TWiki-6.1 Release]].

#AuthenticationOfUsers
---++ Enable Authentication of Users

This step provides for site access control and user activity tracking on your TWiki site. __This is particularly important for sites that are publicly accessible on the web.__ This guide describes only the most common of several possible authentication setups for TWiki and is suitable for public web sites. For information about other setups, see TWikiUserAuthentication, and TWiki:TWiki.TWikiUserAuthenticationSupplement.

These are the steps for enabling "Template Login" which asks for a username and password in a web page, and processes them using the Apache 'htpasswd' password manager. Users can log in and log out.

   1 Under the =Security Settings= pane of =configure= :
      1 Select =TWiki::LoginManager::TemplateLogin= for ={LoginManager}=.
      1 Select =TWiki::Users::HtPasswdUser= for ={PasswordManager}=.
      1 Save your =configure= settings.
      1 Register yourself using the TWikiRegistration topic.<br />
     %H% Check that the password manager recognizes the new user. Check that a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. If not, you probably got a path wrong, or the permissions may not allow the webserver user to write to that file.
   1 Edit a topic (by clicking on the =Edit= link at beginning or end of topic) to check if authentication works.

You are strongly encouraged to read TWikiUserAuthentication, TWiki:TWiki.TWikiUserAuthenticationSupplement, and TWiki:TWiki.SecuringTWikiSite for further information about managing users and security of your TWiki site.

__Note:__ The other =LoginManager= option =TWiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin= uses a basic Apache type authentication where the browser itself prompts you for username and password. Most will find the !TemplateLogin looking nicer. But !ApacheLogin is required when you use Apache authentication methods like mod_ldap where all authentication is handled by an Apache module and not by the TWiki perl code. When you use !ApacheLogin the apache configuration must be set up to require authentication of the some but not all the scripts in the bin directory. This section in the Apache config (or .htaccess) controls this

<verbatim>
<FilesMatch "(attach|edit|manage|rename|save|upload|mail|logon|rest|.*auth).*">
	require valid-user
</FilesMatch>
</verbatim>

The TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator includes this section when you choose _ApacheLogin_. In the example =misc/twiki_httpd_conf.txt= and =bin/.htaccess.txt= files this section is commented out with #. Uncomment the section when you use _ApacheLogin_. It is important that this section is commented out or removed when you use _TemplateLogin_.

#DefineAdminUser   
---++ Define the Administrator User(s)

Administrators have read and write access to any topic in TWiki, regardless of TWiki access controls. When you install TWiki one of the first things you will want to do is define yourself as an administrator. You become an administrator simply by adding yourself to the !TWikiAdminGroup. It is the WikiName and not the login name you add to the group. Editing the [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup]] topic requires that you are an administrator. So to add the first administrator you need to login using the internal TWiki admin user login and the password you defined in configure.

   * Navigate to the [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup]] topic
   * Follow carefully the steps !TWikiAdminGroup of how to become an admin
   * Note that if you use _ApacheLogin_ you have to be registered and logged in before you use the _internal admin login_

#SetPreferences
---++ Set TWiki Preferences

Preferences for customizing many aspects of TWiki are set simply by editing a special topic with TWiki.

   * TWikiPreferences. Read through it and identify any additional settings or changes you think you might need. You can edit the settings in <nop>%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences but these will be overwritten when you later upgrade to a newer TWiki version. Instead copy any settings or variables that you want to customize from <nop>%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences and paste them into <nop>%USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences.  When you later upgrade TWiki simply avoid overwriting the =data/%USERSWEB%/TWikiPreferences.txt= file and all your settings will be kept. Settings in <nop>%USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences overrides settings in both <nop>%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences and any settings defined in plugin topics. See notes at the top of <nop>%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences for more information.

---++ Enable Email Notification

Each TWiki web has an automatic email notification service that sends you an email with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert. To enable this service:
   1 Confirm the Mail and Proxies settings in the Configure interface.
   1 Setup a cron job (or equivalent) to call the =tools/mailnotify= script as described in the MailerContrib topic.

#SmimeSetup
---++ Enable Signed Email Notification

TWiki administrative e-mails are an attractive target for SPAM generators and phishing attacks. One good way to protect against this possibility to enable S/MIME signatures on all administrative e-mails. To do this, you need an an X.509 certificate and private key for the the ={WebMasterEmail}= email account. Obtain these as you would for any other S/MIME e-mail user.

To enable TWiki to sign administrative e-mails:
   1 Enable e-mail as described above
   1 If necessary, convert your certificate and key files to *PEM* format ( _openssl_ has all the necessary utilities)
   1 Place the certificate anyplace convenient that the webserver can read. It should be protected against write. The conventional place under linux is =/etc/pki/tls/certs=
   1 Place the key file in a secure location that *only* the webserver can read. It *must not* be readable by anyone else, and *must not* be served by the webserver.
   1 Using the =configure= script, change the following settings under *Mail and Proxies*: 
      1 Follow the directions under ={MailProgram}= to enable an external mail program such as _sendmail_. Net::SMTP is not supported.
      1 Enter the full path to the certificate file in the ={SmimeCertificateFile}= configuration variable
      1 Enter the full path to the private key file in the ={SmimeKeyFile}= configuration variable
      1 Save the configuration
   1 Re-run the =configure= script an resolve any errors that it identifies

All out-going administrative e-mails will now be signed.

#EnableWebStatistics
---++ Enable !WebStatistics

You can generate a listing manually, or on an automated schedule, of visits to individual pages on a per web basis. For information on setting up this feature, see the TWikiSiteTools topic.

#AutomateRemoval
---++ Automate removal of expired sessions and lease files

Per default TWiki cleans out expired session and lease files each time any topic is viewed. This however comes at a cost of lower performance. It is an advantage to define a negative value in =configure= for ={Sessions}{ExpireAfter}= (turn on expert mode to see it), and install a cronjob to run the =tools/tick_twiki.pl= script. Read The topic TWikiScripts#tick_twiki_pl for details how to do this.

#EnableLocalization
---++ Enable Localization

TWiki now supports displaying of national (non-ascii) characters and presentation of basic interface elements in different languages. To enable these features, see the =Localization= section of =configure=. For more information about these features, see TWiki:TWiki.InternationalizationSupplement.

#TailorUsersTopic
---++ Tailor New User Profile Topic

When a new users registers on your TWiki, a user profile topic is created for them based on the NewUserTemplate topic (and its UserForm). It contains additional resources you can use to:
   * Localize the user topic.
   * Add and remove fields defined in the !UserForm

If you choose to tailor anything you are strongly advised to copy !NewUserTemplate and !UserForm to the %USERSWEB% web and tailor the %USERSWEB% web copies. TWiki will look for the !NewUserTemplate in the %USERSWEB% web first and if it does not exist TWiki uses the default from the %SYSTEMWEB% web. By creating a <nop>%USERSWEB%.NewUserTemplate and its <nop>%USERSWEB%.UserForm you will not loose your customization next time you upgrade TWiki.

If you added or removed fields from the user form you may also want to tailor TWikiRegistration.

#CustomStartWeb
---++ Custom Start Web and Homepage

By default the TWiki home is [[%USERSWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]]. Users tend to create content starting from the homepage. In most cases it is better to [[ManagingWebs][create a new web]] (workspace) for default content. That way the <nop>%USERSWEB% web can be kept clean and used just for users and TWiki groups. For example, you could create an "Intranet" web if TWiki is primarily used as an intranet, or a "KB" web if used as a knowledge base, etc.

If you have a dedicated web as a starting point you obviously want users start at the home of that web. This can be configured in two places: 1. Redirect from site home to web home, and 2. Set the wiki logo URL.

__1. Redirect from site home to web home__

When a user enters the domain name of your TWiki she expects to see the homepage. You can do that either with an Apache rewrite rule or an HTML meta redirect to redirect from =/= to =%SCRIPTURLPATH{view}%/Intranet/WebHome=. Here is an example =index.html= containing an HTML meta redirect you can use: Customize it and put it in your HTML document root on your TWiki sever:

<verbatim>
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;/do/view/Intranet/WebHome" />
</head>
<body>
Redirecting to <a href="/do/view/Intranet/WebHome">Intranet home</a>...
</body>
</html>
</verbatim>

__2. Set the wiki logo URL__

When a user clicks on the logo in the upper left or on the "Home" link in the top-bar she expects to navigate to the new homepage. You can do that by defining and customizing the following setting in [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] as described in the [[#SetPreferences][Set TWiki Preferences]] section:

<pre>
   * URL of the logo:
      * Set <nop>WIKILOGOURL = %<nop>SCRIPTURLPATH{view}%/Intranet/WebHome
</pre>

#CustomizeLogo
---++ Customize the Site Logo

Create a logo with a transparent background and a maximum height of 55 pixels. Attach it to [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences]], raw-edit that topic, and set the following bullet, assuming the name of the logo is =my-logo-100x50.png=:

<pre>
   * Logo of this TWiki installation:
      * Set <nop>WIKILOGOIMG = %<nop>PUBURLPATH%/%<nop>USERSWEB%/TWikiPreferences/my-logo-100x50.png
</pre>

#CustomizeTheLook
---++ Customize the Look of Your TWiki!

The real power of TWiki lies in its flexibility to be customized to meet your needs. You can easily change the look of the default skins (called TopMenuSkin and PatternSkin) by reading the PatternSkinCustomization.

At the official TWiki website you can find more resources. A good place to start exploring what's possible is TWiki:TWiki.TWikiAdminCookBook which offers tips and tricks for customizing your TWiki site. Many of these are appropriate to implement immediately after installing TWiki and before adding content so now's a good time to look at these.

#CustomizeSpecialPages
---++ Customize Special Pages

Some pages are meant to be customized after choice of authentication. If you do not use the internal TWiki password manager the topics that contains the features for changing and resetting passwords and changing the email address should be changed to a note describing how to perform these tasks in your organization. The topics are:

   * ChangePassword
   * ResetPassword
   * ChangeEmailAddress

#InstallPlugins
---++ Install Plugins

TWiki:Plugins.WebHome is an extensive library of plugins for TWiki, that enhance functionality in a huge number of ways. A few plugins are pre-installed in the TWiki distribution. For more information on these, see InstalledPlugins.

You activate installed plugin in the _Plugins_ section of =configure=. In this section you also find a _Find More Extensions_ button which opens an application which can install additional plugins from the TWiki.org website. If you are behind a firewall or your server has no access to the Internet it is also possible to install plugins manually. Manual installation instructions for the plugins can be found in the plugin topics on TWiki.org. Additional documentation on TWiki plugins can be found at TWiki:TWiki.TWikiPluginsSupplement.

Some plugins require that you define their settings in =configure=. You fill find these under the _Extensions_ section of configure.

#WysiwygAndRawEdit
---++ WYSIWYG And Raw Edit

From TWiki release 4.2.0 on the WYSIWYG editor has been replaced by a much better and more powerful editor and it was decided that WYSIWYG would be the default edit mode. An Edit Raw link is available for those that have a need or preference for this mode.

However you may prefer to have the same user interface as in TWiki 4.1 where _Edit_ was the raw text editor and you had a WYSIWYG button. This is possible by adding the following setting in the [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences]], !WebPreferences or user hompages:

   * Set EDITMETHOD = raw

#WebCopyright
---++ Copyright, License and Classification Statements

At the bottom of each topic you will find a default copyright message saying "Copyright &copy; by the contributing authors. All material on this collaboration platform is the property of the contributing authors." The WEBCOPYRIGHT setting defines this. This is often not adequate.

   * If your TWiki is used in a commercial application without public access you should replace this by your normal copyright notice. You should also consider adding classifications (e.g. For Internal Use Only) so people do not have to add this manually to every new topic.
   * If your TWiki is public with public access you need to decide which copyright and license the contributions should be covered by. For open source type applications licenses such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">the GNU Free Documentation License</a>, <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-doc-license.html">FreeBSD Documentation License</a>, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons license</a> are possible licenses to consider. Remember that once people have started contributing it is difficult and not correct to change or impose licenses on existing contributions.

You change the copy right statement globally by taking these steps.

   * Copy the setting WEBCOPYRIGHT from [[%SYSTEMWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] to [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] and alter the copied text to your need.
   * You can create a unique message for each web by adding the WEBCOPYRIGHT setting to !WebPreferences in each web. E.g. adding a confidencial classification to a very restricted web.
   * The WEBCOPYRIGHT in [[%SYSTEMWEB%.WebPreferences]] covers the documentation that comes with TWiki and is covered by the original TWiki Copyright and GPL License. You will normally leave this unchanged.

#TroubleShooting
---++ Troubleshooting

The first step is to re-run the =configure= script and make sure you have resolved all errors, and are satisfied that you understand any warnings.

If, by any chance, you forget the "admin" password, the same used in "configure" script, then please login to the server. Delete ==$TWiki::cfg{Password}= ' ...';==. Set the new password using "configure" script.

Failing that, please check TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki on TWiki.org, the supplemental documentation that help you install TWiki on different platforms, environments and web hosting sites. For example:
   * For Unix or Linux, check TWiki:Codev.TWikiOnUnix and TWiki:Codev.TWikiOnLinux.
   * For Windows, check the TWiki:Codev.WindowsInstallCookbook. 
   * For !MacOS X, check TWiki:Codev.TWikiOnMacOSX.

It is also advisable to review TWiki:Codev/KnownIssuesOfTWiki06x01.

If you need help, ask a question in the TWiki:Support web or on TWiki:Codev/TWikiIRC (irc.freenode.net, channel #twiki)

#SystemRequirements
---++ TWiki System Requirements

Low client and server base requirements are core features that keep TWiki widely deployable, particularly across a range of browser platforms and versions.  Many [[TWiki:Plugins.PluginPackage][Plugins]] and [[TWiki:Plugins.ContribPackage][contrib modules]] exist which enhance and expand TWiki's capabilities; they may have additional requirements.

#NonRootInstallNotes
---++ Notes on Installing TWiki on Non-Root Account

The following supplemental notes to the [[#StandardInstallation][Basic Installation]] instructions apply to installing TWiki on a system where you don't have Unix/Linux root (administrator) privileges, for example, on a hosted Web account or an intranet server administered by someone else.

Referring to the [[#StandardInstallation][Basic Installation]] steps presented above:

   * *Step 2:* If you cannot unpack the TWiki distribution directly in your installation directory, you can unpack the distribution on your local PC and then manually create the directory structure on your host server and upload the files as follows:
      * Using the table below, create a directory structure on your host server
      * Upload the TWiki files by FTP (transfer as text except for the image files in =pub= directory.)
      * __Note:__ Don't worry if you are not able to put the twiki/lib directory at the same level as the =twiki/bin= directory (e.g. because CGI bin directories can't be under your home directory and you don't have root access). You can create this directory elsewhere and configure the =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg= file (done in Step 2).
        | *TWiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |
        | =twiki/= | TWiki package | TWiki root directory, should be secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/= |
        | =twiki/bin/= | CGI bin | move to script-enabled dirctory | =/home/smith/cgi/twiki/= |
        | =twiki/lib/= | library files | leave in TWiki root | =/home/smith/twiki/lib/= |
        | =twiki/locale/= | language files | leave in TWiki root | =/home/smith/twiki/locale/= |
        | =twiki/pub/= | public files | move to HTML document enabled directory | =/home/smith/html/twiki-pub/= |
        | =twiki/data/= | topic data | leave in TWiki root | =/home/smith/twiki/data/= |
        | =twiki/templates/= | web templates | leave in TWiki root | =/home/smith/twiki/templates/= |
        | =twiki/tools/= | TWiki utlilities | leave in TWiki root | =/home/smith/twiki/tools/= |
        | =twiki/working/= | Temporary and internal files | leave in TWiki root | =/home/smith/twiki/working/= |

   * *Step 3:* Files in the pub directory must be readable as a url. This means that directory permissions should be set to =755= (or =775= ) and file permissions should be set to =644= (or =664=). If you can run a =chmod= command, you can accomplish this in two quick steps by running these commands from the root direct:
      * =chmod -R 755 pub=
      * =chmod 644 `find pub -type f -print`=
      * In addition, you should create a =.htaccess= file in the pub directory, using the template included in the distribution entitled =misc/pub-htaccess.txt=.
      * Note: This setup does not provide for absolute security for TWiki attachments. For more information, see TWiki:Codev.SecuringYourTWiki.

   * *Step 6:* In order to run the configure script, create a file called =.htaccess= in the bin directory that includes the following single line: =SetHandler cgi-script= . This informs the server to treat all the perl scripts in the bin directory as scripts.

For additional information about installing TWiki on a hosted accounts, see TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki#WebHostingSites

#WithoutConfigure
---++ Installing Manually Without Configure

It is highly recommended to use run configure from the browser when setting up TWiki. Configure does a lot of the hard work for you.

But there may be instances where you do not want to use configure or where configure simply won't run because of a missing dependency.

The manual steps you have to take are:

   * Copy the file =lib/TWiki.spec= to =lib/LocalSite.cfg=
   * Remove the comment # in front of =$TWiki::cfg{DefaultUrlHost}=, =$TWiki::cfg{ScriptUrlPath}=, =$TWiki::cfg{PubUrlPath}=, =$TWiki::cfg{PubDir}=, =$TWiki::cfg{TemplateDir}=, =$TWiki::cfg{DataDir}=, =$TWiki::cfg{LocalesDir}=, and =$TWiki::cfg{OS}= and make sure these settings have the correct values.
   * Make sure to define at least these settings: =$TWiki::cfg{LoginManager}=, =$TWiki::cfg{WebMasterEmail}=, =$TWiki::cfg{SMTP}{MAILHOST}=, =$TWiki::cfg{SMTP}{SENDERHOST}=.

   1. As already described above, you should protect the configure script from general access. The configure script is designed for use by administrators only and should be restricted to invocation by them only, by using the basic Apache authentication. Because of this there has not been put much effort into hardening the script. The configure script cannot save any settings once the password has been saved the first time, but the script could still be vulnerable to specially crafted field values and the script reveals many details about the webserver that you should not display in public.
   2. You absolutely must turn off any kind of PHP, Perl, Python, Server Side Includes etc in the =pub= directory. TWiki has some built-in protection which renames files with dangerous filenames by appending .txt to the filename. But this is a secondary security measure. The essential action that you must take is to turn off any possible execution of any of the attached files.<br /> Most Linux distributions have a default Apache installation which has PHP and server side include (SSI) enabled.
   3. Make sure that you deny access to all other twiki directories than the =bin= and =pub= directories. When you have access to the Apache config files the =twiki_httpd_conf.txt= file mentioned above also contains protection of these directories.<br />
     For those who do not have access to the Apache config files a sample =subdir-htaccess.txt= file can be copied as =.htaccess= to the data, lib, locale, templates, tools and working directories.
   4. Attachments are not secured by default to the access control setting of the topic. In other words, anyone can read them if they know the direct URL of the attachment, which includes name of the web, topic and attachment. You can [[TWikiAccessControl#SecuringAttachments][configure TWiki to secure attachments]].

Before attempting to install TWiki, you are encouraged to review the AdminSkillsAssumptions. This guide assumes the user installing TWiki has, at a minimum, basic knowledge of server administration on the system on which TWiki is to be installed. While it is possible to install TWiki with FTP access alone (for example, on a hosted site), it is tricky and may require additional support from your hosting service (for example, in setting file ownership and installing missing Perl CPAN libraries).
d17 1
a17 1
While this installation guide specifically describes installation on an Apache web server on Linux, TWiki should be fine with any web server and OS that meet the system requirements (see below). For additional notes on installing TWiki on other systems, see TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki#OtherPlatforms.
d32 1
a32 1
      * __Note:__ TWiki does not allow spaces in the directory names. Especially on Windows make sure to use a directory path without spaces.
d40 2
a41 2
      * If you mistakenly change the access rights in a way that makes TWiki stop working, simply run the script found at TWiki:TWiki.SettingFileAccessRightsLinuxUnix to set the access right of the entire TWiki tree back to the distributed defaults.
      * It is possible to define tighter access rules than the ones given by default after the installation is complete. But how tight they should be depends on your distribution and local needs. Typically you may want to limit all access from world if the webserver machine has login access for other users than root and the web server administrator. For a dedicated web server made just for running TWiki with limited login access the default access rights have a good safety level.
d47 1
a47 1
      * The file =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg= must contain a setting for =$twikiLibPath=, which must point to the absolute file path of your =twiki/lib= e.g. =/var/www/twiki/lib=.
d49 3
a51 3
   1 *Choose best configuration method* for your webserver. There are two ways to configure Apache: config file included from httpd.conf or .htaccess files
      * Apache config file: The recommended method is using a config file. With a config file you can put the entire TWiki configuration in ONE file (typically named =twiki.conf=). Performance is much better with a config file, and one file gives the best overview and ensures that you get a safe installation . However using a config file requires that you can restart Apache which again means that you need root or sudo access to stop and start Apache. The TWiki apache config file is included from the main Apache config file http.conf. Most distributions have a directory from which any file that ends with =.conf= gets included when you restart Apache (Example !RedHat/Fedora/Centos: /etc/httpd/conf.d). If you use a virtual host setup in Apache you should include the twiki.conf file from inside the desired virtual host config in your Apache configuration.
      * .htaccess file: This should only be used when you cannot use a config file. Performance is slowed down because Apache has to look through _all_ directories in search for possible .htaccess files each time someone views a page in TWiki. Normally this is the only way to control Apache in a shared host environment where you have no root or sudo privileges.
d55 4
a58 2
         * In the root of the twiki installation you find an example config file =twiki_httpd_conf.txt=
         * In the root of the twiki installation and in the =twiki/bin= directory you find example =.htaccess= files you can copy and modify. The files contains help text explaining how to set them up. In =twiki/bin= you find =.htaccess.txt= which can be copied to =.htaccess= and defined access to the CGI scripts. In the root of TWiki you find =pub-htaccess.txt= which you can copy to =pub/.htaccess=, =subdir-htaccess.txt= which you can copy to all directories as =.htaccess= except bin and pub, and you find =root-htaccess.txt= which you can copy to =.htaccess= in the twiki root directory. But again only use .htaccess files if you do not have root priviledges.
a60 3
   1 *Protect the configure script*
      * You should never leave the =configure= script open to the public. Limit access to the =twiki/bin/configure= script to either localhost, an IP address or a specific user using basic Apache authentication. The TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator lets you setup who has access to the configure script. Also the example twiki-httpd-conf.txt and bin/.htaccess.txt files includes the needed setting to protect the configure script.
      * If you limit the access to a particular user then you need to setup a .htpasswd file that contains the user name and password that Apache will authenticate against. Per default both TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator and the example config files and .htaccess files uses =twiki/data/.htpasswd= but this file does not exist until you have TWiki running and have registered the first user. You therefore have two options. Either limit the access to localhost or an IP address, or make a .htpasswd file. To make a .htpasswd file change directory to =twiki/data= and issue the command =htpasswd -c .htpasswd username= and enter your password when asked. The username must match the =Require user username= directive in the Apache config file or .htaccess file. Do not use a username you will later use to register in TWiki because TWiki will then claim that you are already registered.
d77 1
a77 1
   1. As already described above you should protect the configure script from general access. The configure script is designed for use by administrators only and should be restricted to invocation by them only, by using the basic Apache authentication. Because of this there has not been put much effort into hardening the script. The configure script cannot save any settings once the password has been saved the first time, but the script could still be vulnerable to specially crafted field values and the script reveals many details about the webserver that you should not display in public.
d80 1
a80 1
     For those that do not have access to the Apache config files a sample =subdir-htaccess.txt= file can be copied as =.htaccess= to the data, lib, locale, templates, tools and working directories.

Administrators have read and write access to any topic in TWiki, irrespectively of TWiki access controls. When you install TWiki one of the first things you will want to do is define yourself as an administrator. You become an administrator simply by adding yourself to the !TWikiAdminGroup. It is the WikiName and not the login name you add to the group. Editing the [[%USERSWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup]] topic requires that you are an administrator. So to add the first administrator you need to login using the internal TWiki admin user login and the password you defined in configure.

You can generate a listing manually, or on an automated schedule, of visits to individual pages, on a per web basis. For information on setting up this feature, see the TWikiSiteTools topic.
d165 1
a165 1
Per default TWiki cleans out expired session and lease files each time any topic is viewed. This however comes at a cost of lower performance. It is an advantage to define a negative value in =configure= for ={Sessions}{ExpireAfter}= (turn on expert mode to see it), and install a crjob to run the =tools/tick_twiki.pl= script. Read The topic TWikiScripts#tick_twiki_pl for details how to do this.
d180 1
a180 1
If you choose to tailor anything you are strongly adviced to copy !NewUserTemplate and !UserForm to the %USERSWEB% web and tailor the %USERSWEB% web copies. TWiki will look for the !NewUserTemplate in the %USERSWEB% web first and if it does not exist it uses the default from the %SYSTEMWEB% web. By creating a <nop>%USERSWEB%.NewUserTemplate and its <nop>%USERSWEB%.UserForm you will not loose your customization next time you upgrade TWiki.

At the official TWiki website you can find more resources. A good place to start for exploring what's possible is TWiki:TWiki.TWikiAdminCookBook which offers tips and tricks for customizing your TWiki site. Many of these are appropriate to implement immediately after installing TWiki and before adding content so now's a good time to look at these.

In the bottom of each topic you will find a default copyright messages saying "Copyright &copy; by the contributing authors. All material on this collaboration platform is the property of the contributing authors." It is a setting WEBCOPYRIGHT that defines this. This is often not adequate.

a268 1
If by any chance you forgot the "admin" password, the same is used in "configure" script, then please login to the server. Delete ==$TWiki::cfg{Password}= ' ...';== . Set the new password using "configure" script.

Low client and server base requirements are core features that keep TWiki widely deployable, particularly across a range of browser platforms and versions.

---+++ Server Requirements

TWiki is written in Perl 5, uses a number of shell commands, and requires <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html" rel="nofollow" target="_top">RCS (Revision Control System)</a>, a GNU Free Software package. TWiki is developed in a basic Linux/Apache environment. It also works with Microsoft Windows, and should have no problem on any other platform that meets the requirements.

| *Resource* | *Required Server Environment* |
| Perl | 5.8.4 or higher is recommended. TWiki will run in perl 5.6.1 but only with Wysiwyg editor disabled. Wysiwyg requires unicode support which is provided by perl 5.8.1 and forward. |
| RCS | 5.7 or higher (including GNU =diff=) <br /> Optional, TWiki includes a pure perl implementation of RCS that can be used instead (although it's slower) |
| GNU =diff= | GNU =diff= 2.7 or higher is required when not using the all-Perl <nop>RcsLite.  <br /> Install on PATH if not included with RCS (check version with =diff -v=)  <br /> Must be the version used by RCS, to avoid problems with binary attachments - RCS may have hard-coded path to =diff= |
| Other external programs | =fgrep, egrep= |
| Cron/scheduler | &#8226; Unix: =cron= <br />&#8226; Windows: =cron= equivalents <!-- SMELL: Macintosh version? --> |
| Web server | Apache is well supported; for information on other servers, see TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki#OtherWebServers. |

---+++ Required CPAN Modules

Most of the !CPAN libraries listesd below are part of a standard Perl installation so you most likely have them all!

See TWiki:TWiki.HowToInstallCpanModules for detailed information on how to install !CPAN libraries

The following Perl <a href="http://cpan.perl.org/" target="_top">CPAN</a> modules are used by TWiki:

| *Module* | *Preferred version* |
| Algorithm::Diff (included) | &nbsp; |
| CGI | Versions 2.89 and 3.37 must be avoided. Most version from 3.15 and onwards should work. |
| CGI::Carp | &gt;=1.26 |
| Config | &gt;=0 |
| Cwd | &gt;=3.05 |
| Data::Dumper | &gt;=2.121 |
| Error (included) | &nbsp; |
| File::Copy | &gt;=2.06 |
| File::Find | &gt;=1.05 |
| File::Spec | &gt;=3.05 |
| !FileHandle | &gt;=2.01 |
| IO::File | &gt;=1.10 |
| Text::Diff (included) | &nbsp; |
| Time::Local | &gt;=1.11 |

---+++ Optional CPAN Modules

The following Perl modules may be used by TWiki:

See TWiki:TWiki.HowToInstallCpanModules for detailed information on how to install !CPAN libraries

| *Module* | *Preferred version* | *Description* |
| Archive::Tar | &nbsp; | May be required by the Extensions Installer in configure if command line tar or unzip is not available |
| CGI::Cookie | &gt;=1.24 | Used for session support |
| CGI::Session | &gt;=3.95 | Highly recommended! Used for session support |
| Crypt::SMIME | &gt;=0.09 | Required if S/MIME-signed administrative e-mail is enabled. |
| Digest::base | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Digest::SHA1 | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Jcode | &nbsp; | Used for !I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Locale::Maketext::Lexicon | &gt;=0 | Used for !I18N support |
| Authen::SASL | &nbsp; | Used for SMTP Authentication |
| Net::SMTP | &gt;=2.29 | Used for sending mail |
| Unicode::Map | &nbsp; | Used for !I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Unicode::Map8 | &nbsp; | Used for !I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Unicode::MapUTF8 | &nbsp; | Used for !I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| Unicode::String | &nbsp; | Used for !I18N support with perl 5.6 |
| URI | &nbsp; | Used for configure |

Most of them will probably already be available in your installation. You can check version numbers with the =configure= script, or if you're still trying to get to that point, check from the command line like this:

<pre>
perl -e 'use FileHandle; print $FileHandle::VERSION."\n"'
</pre>

#ClientRequirements
---+++ Client Requirements

The TWiki standard installation has relatively low browser requirements:

   * HTML 3.2 compliant
   * Cookies, if persistent sessions are required

CSS and Javascript are used in most skins, although there is a low-fat skin (Classic skin) available that minimises these requirements. Some skins will require more recent releases of browsers. The default skin (Pattern) is tested on IE 6, Safari, and Mozilla 5.0 based browsers (such as Firefox).

You can easily select a balance of browser capability versus look and feel. Try the installed skins at TWikiSkinBrowser and more at TWiki:Plugins.SkinPackage.

---+++ Important note about TWiki Plugins

   * Plugins can require just about anything -  browser-specific functions, stylesheets (CSS), Java applets, cookies, specific Perl modules,... - check the individual Plugin specs.
      * __%T% Note:__ Plugins included in the TWiki distribution do not add requirements, except for the CommentPlugin which requires Perl 5.6.1.

The essential action that you must take is to turn off any possible execution of any of the attached files.<br /> Most Linux distributions have a default Apache installation which has PHP and server side include (SSI) enabled.
   * Make sure that you deny access to all other twiki directories than the =bin= and =pub= directories. When you have access to the Apache config files the =twiki_httpd_conf.txt= file mentioned above also contains protection of these directories.<br />

Many of the references below refer to topics within your TWiki installation. For example, =TWiki.TWikiSkins= refers to the =TWikiSkins= topic in your TWiki web. Easy way to jump directly to view the pages is to open your own TWiki in your browser and write =TWiki.TWikiSkins= in the Jump test box to the right in the top bar and hit Enter. You can find these topics in the on-line reference copy at the official TWiki website: [[TWiki:TWiki04x03.WebHome][TWiki Release 4.3]]

*Note!* The other =LoginManager= option =TWiki::LoginManager::ApacheLogin= uses a basic Apache type authentication where the browser itself prompts you for username and password. Most will find the !TemplateLogin looking nicer. But !ApacheLogin is required when you use Apache authentication methods like mod_ldap where all authentication is handled by an Apache module and not by the TWiki perl code. When you use !ApacheLogin the apache configuration must be set up to require authentication of the some but not all the scripts in the bin directory. This section in the Apache config (or .htaccess) controls this

Once you have TWiki installed and running, you might consider the following optional steps for setting up and customizing your TWiki site. Many of the references below refer to topics within your TWiki installation. For example, =TWiki.TWikiSkins= refers to the =TWikiSkins= topic in your TWiki web. Easy way to jump directly to view the pages is to open your own TWiki in your browser and write =TWiki.TWikiSkins= in the Jump test box to the right in the top bar and hit Enter.

This step provides for site access control and user activity tracking on your TWiki site. __This is particularly important for sites that are publicly accessible on the web.__ This guide describes only the most common of several possible authentication setups for TWiki and is suitable for public web sites. For information about other setups, see =TWiki.TWikiUserAuthentication=, and TWiki:TWiki.TWikiUserAuthenticationSupplement.

a104 1
You are strongly encouraged to read =TWiki.TWikiUserAuthentication=, TWiki:TWiki.TWikiUserAuthenticationSupplement, and TWiki:TWiki.SecuringTWikiSite for further information about managing users and security of your TWiki site.
d119 1
a119 1
Administrators have read and write access to any topic in TWiki, irrespectively of TWiki access controls. When you install TWiki one of the first things you will want to do is define yourself as an administrator. You become an administrator simply by adding yourself to the =TWikiAdminGroup=. It is the WikiName and not the login name you add to the group. Editing the =Main.TWikiAdminGroup= topic requires that you are an administrator. So to add the first administrator you need to login using the internal TWiki admin user login and the password you defined in configure.
d121 2
a122 2
   * Navigate to the =Main.TWikiAdminGroup= topic
   * Follow carefully the steps =Main.TWikiAdminGroup= of how to become an admin
d130 1
a130 1
   * =TWiki.TWikiPreferences=. Read through it and identify any additional settings or changes you think you might need. You can edit the settings in =TWiki.TWikiPreferences= but these will be overwritten when you later upgrade to a newer TWiki version. Instead copy any settings or variables that you want to customize from =TWiki.TWikiPreferences= and paste them into =Main.TWikiPreferences=.  When you later upgrade TWiki simply avoid overwriting the =data/Main/TWikiPreferences.txt= file and all your settings will be kept. Settings in =Main.TWikiPreferences= overrides settings in both =TWiki.TWikiPreferences= and any settings defined in Plugin topics. See notes at top of =TWiki.TWikiPreferences= for more information.
d136 1
a136 1
   1 Setup a cron job (or equivalent) to call the =tools/mailnotify= script as described in the =TWiki.MailerContrib= topic.
d159 1
a159 1
You can generate a listing manually, or on an automated schedule, of visits to individual pages, on a per web basis. For information on setting up this feature, see the =TWiki.TWikiSiteTools= topic.
d163 1
a163 1
Per default TWiki cleans out expired session and lease files each time any topic is viewed. This however cost performance. It is an advantage to define a negative value in =configure= for {Sessions}{ExpireAfter} and install let cron run the =tools/tick_twiki.pl= script. Read The topic =TWikiScripts#tick_twiki_pl= for details how to do this.
d172 2
a173 2
When a new users registers on your TWiki, a home topic is created for them based on the =TWiki.NewUserTemplate= topic (and its =TWiki.UserForm=). It contains additional resources you can use to:
   * Localise the user topic.
d175 1
a175 1
   * Add and remove fields defined in the =TWiki.UserForm=
d177 1
a177 1
If you choose to tailor anything you are strongly adviced to copy =NewUserTemplate= and =UserForm= to the Main web and tailor the Main web copies. TWiki will look for the =NewUserTemplate= in the Main web first and if it does not exist it uses the default from the TWiki web. By creating a =Main.NewUserTemplate= and its =Main.UserForm= you will not loose your tailorings next time you upgrade TWiki.

   * You can create a unique message for each web by adding the WEBCOPYRIGHT setting to =WebPreferences= in each web. E.g. adding a confidencial classification to a very restricted web.
   * The WEBCOPYRIGHT in =TWiki.WebPreferences= covers the documentation that comes with TWiki and is covered by the original TWiki Copyright and GPL License. You will normally leave this unchanged.

*The following is installation instructions for the TWiki 4.1 production release on an Apache web server on Linux.* Visit TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki for the latest updates to this guide and supplemental information for installing or upgrading TWiki, including notes on installing TWiki on different platforms, environments and web hosting sites.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of TWiki, you probably want to read TWikiUpgradeGuide instead (both this document and the !TWikiUpgradeGuide are also available in the root of the distribution as HTML files)
d15 1
a15 1
Before attempting to install TWiki, you are encouraged to review the TWiki:TWiki.AdminSkillsAssumptions. This guide assumes the person installing TWiki has, at a minimum, basic knowledge of server administration and cgi script management on the system on which TWiki is to be installed. While it is possible to install TWiki with FTP access alone (for example, on a hosted site), it is tricky and may require additional support from your hosting service (for example, in setting file ownership).
d17 1
a17 1
To help setup a correct Apache configuration, you can use the automatic TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator which generates the contents for an Apache config file for TWiki based on your inputs.
d21 3
a23 1
If you are installing TWiki without Unix/Linux root (administrator) privileges (for example, on a hosted domain), see "Notes on Installing TWiki on Non-Root Account" below for supplemental instructions to the basic steps presented below.
d25 1
a25 1
If you are upgrading from an earlier major version of TWiki such a Cairo (TWiki 3) you will need the information found in TWiki:TWiki.TWikiUpgradeGuide which includes a description of both an automated and a manual procedure. The manual procedure is probably the safest to follow but takes more time. The upgrade guide describes essential steps needed to avoid problems with locked topics. 
d27 1
a27 1
Upgrading from a recent TWiki4 release is much simpler. Upgraders from earlier TWiki4 versions can with advantage follow the steps described in TWiki:TWiki.UpgradingTWiki04x00PatchReleases to ensure a safe upgrade without accidently overwriting customizations.
d36 35
a70 18
   1 *Make sure* the user that runs CGI scripts on your system can read and write all files in the distribution. <br />
     Detailed instructions on file permissions are beyond the scope of this guide, and the best and safest set of file and directory permissions depend on the actual server environment. For Unix/Linux see TWiki:TWiki.SettingFileAccessRightsLinuxUnix which contains scripts to setup the right file and directory access rights.<br />
     The general rules for access rights are:
      * During installation and configuration, the CGI user needs to be able to read and write _everything_ in the distribution.
      * Once installation and configuration is complete, the CGI user needs write access to everything under the =data= and =pub= directories and to =twiki/lib/LocalSite.cfg=. _Everything else_ should be read-only.
      * Everybody else should be denied access to everything, always.
   1 *Make sure* Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system.<br />
     The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. *If it's somewhere else*, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory.<br />
     %H% Some systems require a special extension on perl scripts (e.g. =.cgi= or =.pl=). If necessary, rename all files in =twiki/bin=  (i.e. rename =view= to =view.pl= etc). If you do this, make sure you set the =ScriptSuffix= option in =configure= (Step 6).
   1 *Create the file* =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=.<br />
     There is a template for this file in =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt=.<br />
     The file =twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt= must contain a setting for =$twikiLibPath=, which must point to the absolute file path of your =twiki/lib= e.g. =/home/httpd/twiki/lib=.<br />
     %H% If you need to install additional [[http://cpan.perl.org/][CPAN]] modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server, you can set =$CPANBASE= to point to your personal [[http://cpan.perl.org/][CPAN]] install. Don't forget that the webserver user has to be able to read those files as well.
   1 *Configure the webserver* so you can execute the =bin/configure= script from your browser. But limit the access to either localhost, an IP address or a specific user using basic Apache authentication. You should never leave the =configure= script open to the public. See TWiki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator which contains a tool that can generate a safe and working config file for TWiki on Apache.
      * If you are unsure about how to do this on your system, see TWiki:TWiki.InstallingTWiki#OtherPlatforms for links to information about various server setups. There is an example Apache =httpd.conf= file in =twiki_httpd_conf.txt= at the root of the package. This file also contains advice on securing your installation. There's also a script called =tools/rewriteshebang.pl= to help you in fixing up the shebang lines in your CGI scripts.
   1 *Run the =configure= script* from your browser (i.e. enter =http://yourdomain/twiki/bin/configure= into your browser address bar) and resolve any errors or warnings it tells you about.<br />
     %X% When you run =configure= for the first time, you can only edit the section =General Path Settings=. Save these settings, and then return to =configure= to continue configuration.<br />
     When you return to configure you now need to setup _Mail and Proxies_. Especially the ={WebMasterEmail}=, and ={SMTP}{MAILHOST}= must be defined to enable TWiki to send registration emails. Many ISPs have introduced authentication when sending emails to fight spam so you may also have to set ={SMTP}{Username}= and ={SMTP}{Password}=. 
d77 2
a78 3
   * You should protect the configure script from general access. The configure script the tool is designed for use by administrators only and should be restricted to invocation by them only, by using the basic Apache authentication. Because of this there has not been put much effort into hardening the script. The configure script cannot save any settings once the password has been saved the first time, but the script could still be vulnerable to specially crafted field values and the script reveals many details about the webserver that you should not display in public.
   * You absolutely must turn off any kind of PHP, Perl, Python, Server Side Includes etc in the =pub= directory. TWiki has some builtin protection which renames files with dangerous filenames by appending .txt to the filename. But this is a secondary security measure. The essential action that you must take is to turn off any possible execution of any of the attached files.<br /> Most Linux distributions have a default Apache installation which has PHP and server side include (SSI) enabled. The =twiki_httpd_conf.txt= file provided in the root of the twiki directory is an example of an Apache config file which you would normally include from httpd.conf. In many distributions this happens automatically if the file is copied to a specific directory (Example !RedHat/Fedora/Centos: /etc/httpd/conf.d) and has suffix =.conf=. This example file shows how to protect the =pub= directory from executing both PHP scripts and server side includes.<br />
     If you do not have access to the apache config files you can normally control control access by placing a file called =.htaccess= in the directory you want to protect. The =pub-htaccess.txt= file provided in the root of the twiki directory is an example of an Apache =.htaccess= file which protects against execusion of PHP and SSI scripts.
d80 1
a80 1
     For those that do not have access to the Apache config files a sample =subdir-htaccess.txt= file can be copied as =.htaccess= to the data, lib, locale, templates and tools directories.

The TWIki:TWiki.ApacheConfigGenerator will help you address all 3 security elements.

Once you have TWiki installed and running, you might consider the following optional steps for setting up and customizing your TWiki site. Many of the references below refer to topics within your TWiki installation. For example, =TWiki.TWikiSkins= refers to the =TWikiSkins= topic in your TWiki web. If not available locally, you can find these topics in the on-line reference copy of [[TWiki:TWiki04x01.WebHome][TWiki Release 4.1]].
a101 3
   1 Edit the =Main/TWikiAdminGroup= topic to include users with system administrator status. Additional instructions are provided in that topic.<br />
   %X% This is a very important step, as users in this group can access all topics, independent of TWiki access controls.
   1 Clear admin notes: Some pages are meant to be customized after choice of authentication - check and update these topics (remove notice): =Main.TWikiAdminGroup=, =TWiki.ChangePassword=, =TWiki.ResetPassword=, and =TWiki.ChangeEmailAddress=.
d103 20

a129 2
   * Edit =TWiki.TWikiPreferences=. Read through it and set any additional settings you think you might need. (You can click the 'Edit' button near the top to edit the settings in place).
   * %T% Alternately, you can copy any settings or variables that you want to customize from =TWiki.TWikiPreferences= and paste them into =Main.TWikiPreferences=. This will protect your local customizations from being overwritten in later upgrades. See notes at top of =TWiki.TWikiPreferences= for more information.

   1 Setup a cron job (or equivalent) to call the =bin/mailnotify= script as described in the =TWiki.MailerContrib= topic.
d143 1

Per default TWiki cleans out expired session and lease files each time any topic is viewed. This however cost performance. It is an advantage to define a negative value in =configure= for {Sessions}{ExpireAfter} and install let cron run the =tools/tick_twiki.pl= script. Read The topic TWikiScripts#tick_twiki_pl for details how to do this.

TWiki now supports displaying of national (non-ascii) characters and presentation of basic interface elements in different languages. To enable these features, see the =Localisation= section of =configure=.

TWiki should be fine with any web server and OS that meet the [[TWikiSystemRequirements][system requirements]]. The following installation instructions are written for experienced system administrators; please review the AdminSkillsAssumptions before you install TWiki. If you need help, ask a question in the TWiki:Support web or on TWiki:Codev.TWikiIRC (irc.freenode.net, channel #twiki)

   1 *Make a directory* for the installation and *unpack the distribution* in it.
   1 *Make sure* the user that runs CGI scripts on your system can read and write all files in the distribution.
     %BR% Detailed instructions on file permissions are beyond the scope of this guide, but in general:
      * During installation and configuration, the CGI user needs to be able to read and write _everything_ in the distribution,
      * Once installation and configuration is complete, the CGI user needs write access to everything under the =data= and =pub= directories and to =lib/LocalSite.cfg=. _Everything else_ should be read-only.

   1 *Make sure* Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. 
     %BR% The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. *If it's somewhere else*, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory.
     %BR% %H% Some systems require a special extension on perl scripts (e.g. =.cgi= or =.pl=). If necessary, rename all files in =twiki/bin=  (i.e. rename =view= to =view.pl= etc). If you do this, make sure you set the =ScriptSuffix= option in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] (Step 6).
   1 *Create the file* =/twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg=.
     %BR% There is a template for this file in =/twiki/bin/LocalLib.cfg.txt=.

---++ Next Steps
Once you have your TWiki running, you can move on to customise it for your users.
   * *Review TWikiPreferences settings* - read through it and set any additional settings you think you might need (you can click the 'Edit' button near the top to edit the settings in place)
      * %I% It is recommended to *copy* any settings or variables that you want to customize from [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] and *paste* them into [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]]. This will protect your local customizations from being overwritten in later upgrades. See notes at top of [[%TWIKIWEB%.TWikiPreferences]] for more information.
   * *Customize user home pages* - read and change NewUserTemplate.
   * *Enable authentication* - read TWikiUserAuthentication.
   * *Clear admin notes* - some pages are meant to be customized after choice of authentication - check and update these topics (remove notice):
      * ChangePassword
      * ResetPassword
      * ChangeEmailAddress
      * TWikiRegistration fields can be customzied to the needs of your organization
      * %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup
   * *Enable e-mail notification* - read TWikiSiteTools#WebNotify to get WebChangesAlerts.
   * *Automate update of site statistics* - read TWikiSiteTools#WebStatistics
   * *Automate removal of expired sessions and lease files* - read TWikiScripts#tick_twiki_pl.
   * *Enable internationalization* if needed - read TWiki:TWiki/InstallationWithI18N (supplemental documentation on TWiki.org)
   * *Install Plugins* if needed - TWiki:Plugins is an extensive library of Plugins for TWiki, that enhance functionality in a huge number of ways. A few Plugins are pre-installed in the TWiki distribution. Installation instructions are included in Plugins you download from TWiki:Plugins.PluginPackage on TWiki.org.
   * *Review known issues* - visit TWiki:Codev.KnownIssuesOfTWiki04x01 and fix issues that apply to you.

These installation steps are based on the *Apache* web server on *Linux*. TWiki runs on other web servers and Unix systems, and should be fine with any web server and OS that meet the [[TWikiSystemRequirements][system requirements]].  Official documentation for platforms other than Linux is somewhat limited, so _please check_ the topics listed below, they include some important tips for HP-UX, Solaris, OS/390, and many other platforms.

	* For Unix or Linux, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnUnix (install your own RCS, =diff= and =grep= tools if in doubt!) and TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnLinux.
	* For Windows, check the WindowsInstallCookbook. 
	* For <nop>MacOS X, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnMacOSX. 
	* To install TWiki on <nop>SourceForge, for use on a software development project, read TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnSourceForge
	* For other platforms, see TWiki:Codev/TWikiOn, and search the TWiki:Codev and TWiki:Support webs for other installation notes.
	* If you need help, ask a question in the TWiki:Support web

---++ Standard Installation

Download the TWiki 01-Sep-2004 distribution in Unix ZIP format from http://TWiki.org/download.html. Please review the AdminSkillsAssumptions before you install TWiki.

---+++ Step 1: Create &amp; Configure the Directories

%X% *NOTE:* _If you don't have access to your Web server configuration files - for example, if you're installing on an ISP-hosted account, or you don't have administrator privileges on your intranet server - use the [[#StepOneB][alternative Step 1]] instead._

	* Create directory =/home/httpd/twiki= and [[http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html][unzip]] the TWiki distribution into this directory.
	* The =twiki/bin= directory of TWiki must be set as a cgi-bin directory. Add =/home/httpd/twiki/bin= to file =httpd.conf= (typcially located in =/etc/httpd/=) with only =ExecCGI= option.
	* The =twiki/pub= directory of TWiki must be set so that it is visible as a URL. Add =/home/httpd/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= with normal access options (copy from =/home/httpd/html= ).
	* Now add =ScriptAlias= for =/twiki/bin= and =Alias= for =/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= .
	  <br /> %X% *NOTE:* The =ScriptAlias= __must__ come before the =Alias=, otherwise, Apache will fail to correctly set up =/twiki/bin/=, by treating it as just another subdirectory of the =/twiki/= alias.
	* The =twiki/data= and =twiki/templates= directories should be set so that they are *not* visible as URLs. Add them to =httpd.conf= with =deny from all=.

<blockquote style="background-color:#F5F5F5">
*Example =httpd.conf= entries:*
 <pre> Script<nop>Alias /twiki/bin/ "/home/httpd/twiki/bin/"
 Alias /twiki/ "/home/httpd/twiki/"
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/bin"&gt;
	 Options +ExecCGI
	 Set<nop>Handler cgi-script
	 Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/pub"&gt;
	 Options Follow<nop>Sym<nop>Links +Includes
	 Allow<nop>Override None
	 Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/data"&gt;
	 deny from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/templates"&gt;
	 deny from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

	* Restart Apache by =service httpd restart= (or as appropriate to your flavor of UNIX or Linux).
	* Test that the =twiki/bin= directory is CGI-enabled by trying visiting it in your browser:
		* Enter the URL for the =bin= directory, =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/=
		* Your settings are OK if you get a message like ="Forbidden. You don't have permission to access /twiki/bin/ on this server"=.
		* Settings are NOT correct if you get something like ="Index of /twiki/bin"= - recheck your =httpd.conf= file. 

	* _Go directly to [[#StepTwo][Step 2]]..._

#StepOneB		  
---++++ Aletrnative Step 1: Create &amp; Configure the Directories for Non-Root Accounts

To install TWiki on a system where you don't have Unix/Linux root (administrator) privileges, for example, on a hosted Web account or an intranet server administered by someone else: 

	* Download and unzip TWiki on your local PC
	* Using the table below, create a directory structure on your host server
	* Upload the TWiki files by FTP (transfer as _text_ except for the image files in =pub=)
<blockquote>
| *TWiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |
| =twiki= | start-up pages | root TWiki dir | =/home/smith/twiki/= |
| =twiki/bin= | CGI bin | CGI-enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/bin= |
| =twiki/lib= | library files | same level as =twiki/bin= | =/home/smith/twiki/lib= |
| =twiki/pub= | public files | htdoc enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/pub= |
| =twiki/data= | topic data | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/data= |
| =twiki/templates= | web templates | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/templates= |
</blockquote>

__Note:__ Don't worry if you are not able to put the =twiki/lib= directory at the same level as the =twiki/bin= directory (e.g. because CGI =bin= directories can't be under your home directory and you don't have root access). You can create this directory elsewhere and configure the =/twiki/bin/setlib.cfg= file (done in Step 3)

#StepTwo
---+++ Step 2: Set File Permissions

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. If it's elsewhere, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory, or create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl=.
		* *IMPORTANT:*
			* On ISP-hosted accounts (and some intranet servers), Perl CGI scripts may require a =.cgi= extension to run. Some systems need =.pl=, the regular Perl extension. Rename all =twiki/bin= scripts if necessary.
			* Alternatively, you might try creating a file =twiki/bin/.htaccess= that contains the single line =SetHandler cgi-script=, which tells Apache to treat all files in this directory as CGI scripts.
	* Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory as executable to =-rwxr-xr-x= (755).
	* To be able to edit the Perl scripts and =.tmpl= files it is necessary to =chown= and =chgrp -R twiki= so all the files have the owner you want.
	* %H% This Guide assumes user =nobody= ownership for all files manipulated by the CGI scripts (executed by the Web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. You can: 
		* replace =nobody= with another user if your server executes scripts under a different name (ex: default for Debian is =www-data=).
			* %T% *HINT:* Run the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. It will show you the user name of the CGI scripts, a table listing all CGI environment variables, and a test of your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file (you'll configure that in a minute).
		* replace user =twiki= with your own username
	* Set permissions manually.
		* Set the permission of all *files* below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =-rw-rw-r--= (664) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
		* Set the permission of the =twiki/data= *directory* and its *subdirectories* so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
		* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
		* %H% The =twiki/data/*/*.txt,v= RCS repository files in the installation package are locked by user =nobody=. If your CGI scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=, it's not possible to check in files (you'll see that the revision number won't increase after saving a topic). In this case, you need to unlock all repository files (check the RCS man pages) and lock them with a different user, such as =www-data=, or delete them all - new files will be automatically created the first time each topic is edited. You have two options to change ownership of the RCS lock user:
			* Run the =testenv= script from your browser; in the %BROWN% *Fix* %ENDCOLOR% line you can <u>relock</u> all the rcs files *(recommended)*
			* Alternatively, run this in your shell: %BR%
			  =cd twiki/data= %BR%
			  =find . -name *,v -exec perl -pi~ -e '$. &lt;=<nop> 10 && s/nobody:/www-data:/ ' {} \;= %BR%
			  This will create =*,v~= backup files which you should remove after verification: %BR%
			  =find . -name *,v~ -exec rm -f {} \;=


---+++ Step 3: Edit the Configuration Files

	* Edit the file =/twiki/bin/setlib.cfg=
		* Set =$twikiLibPath= to the absolute file path of your =/twiki/lib= as seen by the web server.
		* %X% __Attention:__ Do *not* leave it as a relative ="../lib"= path or Plugins might fail to initialize properly
		* You can also edit =$localPerlLibPath= if you are not root and need to install additional CPAN modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server.  Just set this variable to the full pathname to your local lib directory, typically under your home directory. 
		* %X% __Attention:__ If you are running TWiki on Apache 2.0 on Unix you might experience cgi scripts to hang forever. This is a known Apache 2.0 bug. See details and woraround in the =setlib.cfg= file.
	* Edit the file =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg=, setting the variables to your needs.
		* Set the file extension in the =$scriptSuffix= variable to =cgi= or =pl= if required.
		* RCS - revision control system to store revision of topics and attachments.  You can use RCS executables or a version of RCS written in Perl, note that as the time of writing (Apr 2002) the Perl version has not been widely tested, so if you want to put up a live site the RCS executables are recommended. 
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsWrap";</code> for the RCS executables and make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= to match the location of your RCS binaries. You can check this by issuing the command =rcs= at the prompt, it should result in something like ="rcs: no input file"=.  
				* Check that you have GNU =diff=, by typing =diff -v= - an error indicates you have a non-GNU diff, so install the GNU =diffutils= package and make sure that =diff= is on the PATH used by TWiki (see =$safeEnvPath= in the =TWiki.cfg= file).
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsLite";</code> for the Perl based RCS
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all their subdirectories should be set so that they are __not__ visible through URLs. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= accordingly)
	* Test your settings by running the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. Check if your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file settings are correct.


---+++ Step 4: Internationalisation Setup (Optional)

By default, TWiki is configured to support US ASCII letters (no accents) in WikiWords, and ISO-8859-1 (Western European) characters in page contents.  If that's OK for you, skip this step.

If your Wiki will be used by non-English speakers, TWiki can be configured for Internationalisation ('I' followed by 18 letters, then 'N', or _I18N_).  Specifically, TWiki will support suitable accented characters in WikiWords (as well as languages such as Japanese or Chinese in which WikiWords do not apply), and will support virtually any character set in the contents of pages.  __NOTE:__ TWiki does not currently support UTF-8, so you are advised *not* to use this - however, improved UTF-8 support is under development, see TWiki:Codev/ProposedUTF8SupportForI18N.

To configure internationalisation suppport:
	1 Edit the =TWiki.cfg= file's Internationalisation section to set the =$useLocale= parameter to =1=.  TWiki will now use the I18N parameters set in the rest of this section.
	1 Type the Unix/Linux command =locale -a= to find a suitable 'locale' for your use of TWiki.  A locale that includes a dot followed by a character set is recommended, e.g. =pl_PL.ISO-8859-2= for Poland.  Consult your system administrator if you are not sure which locale to use.
	1 In =TWiki.cfg=, set the =$siteLocale= parameter to your chosen locale, e.g. =pl_PL.ISO-8859-2= for Poland. 
	1 Check your setup using =testenv= (download the latest =testenv= from TWiki:Support/SupportGuidelines if possible) - this provides some diagnostics for I18N setup, and in particular checks that your locale can be used successfully.
	1 _(For upgrade of TWiki I18N sites only:)_ If you were using TWiki:Codev.TWikiRelease01Feb2003 support for I18N, and are using Internet Explorer or Opera, you should re-configure your browser so that it sends URLs encoded with UTF-8 (supported since TWiki:Codev.TWikiRelease01Sep2004).  If you are doing a new installation of TWiki, you can ignore this step - no browser reconfiguration is needed for TWiki Release 01-Sep-2004).
		* Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher: in  _Tools | Options | Advanced_, check 'always send URLs as UTF-8', then close all IE windows and restart IE. 
		* Opera 6.x or higher: in _Preferences | Network | International Web Addresses_, check 'encode all addresses with UTF-8'.
		* __NOTE:__ This does not mean that TWiki supports UTF-8 as a site character set.
	1 Try out your TWiki by creating pages in the Sandbox web that use international characters in WikiWords and checking that searching, WebIndex, Ref-By and other features are working OK.

---++++ Trouble with I18N? 

If international characters in WikiWords do not seem to work, and you are on Perl 5.6 or higher, you may need to set the =TWiki.cfg= parameter =$localeRegexes= to 0 - this disables some features but enables TWiki to work even if your system has locales that do not work.  Then, set the =$upperNational= and =$lowerNational= parameters to the valid upper and lower case accented letters for your locale. 
	* __NOTE:__ You will need to do the above workaround for Windows based servers (whether using Cygwin or <nop>ActiveState Perl), since Perl locales are not working on Windows as of Feb 2004.

If international characters in WikiWords aren't working, and you are on Perl 5.005 with working locales, keep =$useLocale= set to 1 and set =$localeRegexes= to 0, then set =$upperNational= and =$lowerNational= - if =testenv= generates the lists of characters for you, your locales are working so there is no need to set =$localeRegexes= to 0 in this case.  See the comments in =TWiki.cfg= for more information.

---+++ Step 5: Configure Site-Wide Email Preferences

	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the %TWIKIWEB% web (by pointing your browser to <nop>http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view/%TWIKIWEB%/TWikiPreferences) to set the =WIKIWEBMASTER= email address, and other email settings required for registration and WebChangesAlert to work:
		* =WIKIWEBMASTER= should be set to the email address of the TWiki administrator
		* =SMTPMAILHOST= is typically set on Windows or other non-Unix/Linux systems, where =sendmail= or similar is not available.  When this is set and the Perl module ==Net::SMTP== is installed, TWiki will connect to this SMTP server (e.g. =mail.yourdomain.com=) to send email for user registration and WebChangesAlerts.  If you do have a sendmail-type program, leave =SMTPMAILHOST= unset so that the external sendmail program is used instead (defined by ==$mailProgram== in ==TWiki.cfg==).
		* =SMTPSENDERHOST= is optional, and set to the domain name sending the email (e.g. =twiki.yourdomain.com=). For use where the SMTP server requires that you identify the TWiki server sending mail. If not set, ==Net::SMTP== will guess it for you. 
	* You may want to set up other TWikiPreferences later on.
	* To enable the WebChangesAlerts (email notifications) you need to read about cron in the topic TWiki.TWikiSiteTools.

---+++ Step 6: Finish Up from Your Browser

	* Point your Web browser at =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view= and start TWiki-ing away!
		* %T% Or, point to =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/= to get the pre-TWiki =index.html= page, with a link to the =view= script. Customize this page if you want a public intro screen with a login link, instead of immediately calling up the .htaccess login dialog by going directly to =view=.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set individual =WEBCOPYRIGHT= messages, and other preferences.
	* Enable email notification of topic changes - TWikiSiteTools has more. 
	* Edit the WebNotify topic in all webs and add the users you want to notify.
	* Add the TWiki:Main/PoweredByTWikiLogo to your [[%MAINWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]] topic.
	* You can add new =%<nop>VARIABLES%=. Define site-level variables in the TWikiPreferences topic. See also: TWikiVariables.

That's it for the standard installation of TWiki. Read on for server-level customization options.

---++ Additional Server-Level Options

With your new TWiki installation up and running, you can manage most aspects of your site from the browser interface. Only a few functions require access to the server file system, via Telnet or FTP. You can make these server-level changes during installation, and at any time afterwards.

---+++ Enabling Authentication of Users

	* If TWiki is installed on a non-authenticated server - not using SSL - and you'd like to authenticate users:
		1. *Rename* file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. The comment at the top of the file explains what need to be done, basically replace =!FILE_path_to_TWiki!= and =!URL_path_to_TWiki!= with paths specific to your installation. _For the details of how this file works, consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://systems.mcs.kent.edu/info/web_help/htaccess/">[2]</a>)_.
			* %X% *NOTE:* If you had to add a =.cgi= or =.pl= file extension to the =bin= scripts, make sure to do the same for =edit=, =view=, =preview=, and all the other script names in =.htaccess=. 
			* %H% The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect, you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#directory>[3]</a> section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory. 
				* *This applies only if you have root access:* on hosted accounts, you shouldn't have this problem - otherwise, email tech support.
			* %X% *NOTE:* In the TWiki distribution package, the =twiki/data/.htpasswd.txt= file contains several TWiki core team user accounts and a guest user account. You probably want to remove those accounts by deleting the entries in =.htpasswd=. Do not remove the guest user if you want to allow guest logins.
		1. TWiki now supports several Password file format/encoding methods for Apache. Once you know what method is used by your Appache server, you can configure TWiki to create compatible .htpasswd entries by editing the =$htpasswdFormatFamily=, =$htpasswdEncoding= and =$htpasswdFilename= in the TWiki.cfg file. The supported options are htpasswd:plain, htpasswd:crypt, htpasswd:sha1, htdigest:md5
		1. *Copy* the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration, overwriting old version of <nop>TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
	* Customization:
		* You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are carried over into the user home page correctly.
		* You can customize the default user home page in NewUserTemplate. The same variables get expanded as in the [[TWikiTemplates#Template_Topics][template topics]]
	* Register yourself in the TWikiRegistration topic.
		* %X% *NOTE:* When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. The =.htpasswd= file that comes with the TWiki installation includes user accounts for TWiki core team members that are used for testing on TWiki.org. You can edit the file and delete those lines.
	* Create a new topic to check if authentication works.
	* Edit the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup topic in the TWiki:%MAINWEB% web to include users with system administrator status.
	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the TWiki:%TWIKIWEB% web to set access privileges.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set access priviliges.

---+++ WYSIWYG Editor

At this time, TWiki does not ship with an "what you see is what you get" editor. TWiki:Codev/IntegrateHtmlAreaEditor describes how to integrate an HTML editor.

%X% *NOTE:* User home topics are located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web - don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any other web, user signatures have to point to %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, using a =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= format. (The =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is an advantage if you ever change the %MAINWEB% web name, but the standard =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= is easier for users to enter, which is the bottom line!)

---# TWiki Installation Guide

_Installation instructions for the TWiki 01-Feb-2003 production release._

_If you are reading this on your own TWiki installation, please get the latest installation guide (TWiki:TWiki.TWikiInstallationGuide), as this often has important updates to resolve installation issues._

These installation steps are based on the *Apache* web server on *Linux*. TWiki runs on other web servers and Unix systems, and should be fine with any web server and OS that meet the [[TWikiSystemRequirements][system requirements]].  Official documentation for platforms other than Linux is somewhat limited, so _please check_ the topics listed below, they include some important tips for HP-UX, Solaris, OS/390, and many other platforms.

	* For Unix or Linux, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnUnix (install your own RCS, =diff= and =grep= tools if in doubt!) and TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnLinux.
	* For Windows, check the WindowsInstallCookbook. 
	* For <nop>MacOS X, check TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnMacOSX. 
	* To install TWiki on <nop>SourceForge, for use on a software development project, read TWiki:Codev/TWikiOnSourceForge
	* For other platforms, see TWiki:Codev/TWikiOn, and search the TWiki:Codev and TWiki:Support webs for other installation notes.
	* If you need __really urgent__ help, try the TWiki:Codev/TWikiIRC channel.

#StandardInstallation
---++ Standard Installation

Request and download the TWiki 01-Feb-2003 distribution in Unix ZIP format from http://TWiki.org/download.html. Please review the AdminSkillsAssumptions before you install TWiki.

---+++ Step 1: Create &amp; Configure the Directories

%X% *NOTE:* _If you don't have access to your Web server configuration files - for example, if you're installing on an ISP-hosted account, or you don't have administrator privileges on your intranet server - use the [[#StepOneB][alternative Step 1]] instead._

	* Create directory =/home/httpd/twiki= and [[http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html][unzip]] the TWiki distribution into this directory.
	* The =twiki/bin= directory of TWiki must be set as a cgi-bin directory. Add =/home/httpd/twiki/bin= to file =httpd.conf= (typcially located in =/etc/httpd/=) with only =ExecCGI= option.
	* The =twiki/pub= directory of TWiki must be set so that it is visible as a URL. Add =/home/httpd/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= with normal access options (copy from =/home/httpd/html= ).
	* Now add =ScriptAlias= for =/twiki/bin= and =Alias= for =/twiki= to file =httpd.conf= .
	  <br /> %X% *NOTE:* The =ScriptAlias= __must__ come before the =Alias=, otherwise, Apache will fail to correctly set up =/twiki/bin/=, by treating it as just another subdirectory of the =/twiki/= alias.
	* The =twiki/data= and =twiki/templates= directories should be set so that they are *not* visible as URLs. Add them to =httpd.conf= with =deny from all=.

<blockquote style="background-color:#F5F5F5">
*Example =httpd.conf= entries:*
 <pre> Script<nop>Alias /twiki/bin/ "/home/httpd/twiki/bin/"
 Alias /twiki/ "/home/httpd/twiki/"
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/bin"&gt;
	 Options +ExecCGI
	 Set<nop>Handler cgi-script
	 Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/pub"&gt;
	 Options Follow<nop>Sym<nop>Links +Includes
	 Allow<nop>Override None
	 Allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/data"&gt;
	 deny from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/twiki/templates"&gt;
	 deny from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

	* Restart Apache by =/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S85httpd restart= .
	* Test that the =twiki/bin= directory is CGI-enabled by trying visiting it in your browser:
		* Enter the URL for the =bin= directory, =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/=.
		* Your settings are OK if you get a message like ="Forbidden. You don't have permission to access /twiki/bin/ on this server"=.
		* Settings are NOT correct if you get something like ="Index of /twiki/bin"= - recheck your =httpd.conf= file. 

	* _Go directly to [[#StepTwo][Step 2]]..._

#StepOneB		  
---++++ Step 1 for Non-Root Accounts

To install TWiki on a system where you don't have Unix/Linux root (administrator) privileges, for example, on a hosted Web account or an intranet server administered by someone else: 

	* Download and unzip TWiki on your local PC
	* Using the table below, create a directory structure on your host server
	* Upload the TWiki files by FTP (transfer as _text_ except for the image files in =pub=)
<blockquote>
| *TWiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |
| =twiki= | start-up pages | root TWiki dir | =/home/smith/twiki/= |
| =twiki/bin= | CGI bin | CGI-enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/bin= |
| =twiki/lib= | library files | same level as =twiki/bin= | =/home/smith/twiki/lib= |
| =twiki/pub= | public files | htdoc enabled dir | =/home/smith/twiki/pub= |
| =twiki/data= | topic data | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/data= |
| =twiki/templates= | web templates | dir secure from public access | =/home/smith/twiki/templates= |
</blockquote>

If you are not able to create the =twiki/lib= directory at the same level as the =twiki/bin= directory (e.g. because CGI =bin= directories can't be under your home directory and you don't have root access), you can create this directory elsewhere and edit the =setlib.cfg= file in the =bin= directory:

<pre>
	 # -------------- Change these settings if required

	 $twikiLibPath = <font color="red">'/some/other/path/lib'</font>;	# Path to lib directory containing TWiki.pm

</pre>

You can also edit =$localPerlLibPath= in the =setlib.cfg= file if you are not root and need to install additional CPAN modules, but can't update the main Perl installation files on the server.  Just set this variable to the full pathname to your local lib directory, typically under your home directory. 

#StepTwo
---+++ Step 2: Set File Permissions

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. If it's elsewhere, change the path to Perl in the first line of each script in the =twiki/bin= directory, or create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl=.
		* *IMPORTANT:* On ISP-hosted accounts (and some intranet servers), Perl CGI scripts may require a =.cgi= extension to run. Some systems need =.pl=, the regular Perl extension. Rename all =twiki/bin= scripts if necessary.
	* Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory as executable to =-rwxr-xr-x= (755).
	* To be able to edit the Perl scripts and =.tmpl= files it is necessary to =chown= and =chgrp -R twiki= so all the files have the owner you want.
	* %H% This Guide assumes user =nobody= ownership for all files manipulated by the CGI scripts (executed by the Web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. You can: 
		* replace =nobody= with another user if your server executes scripts under a different name (ex: default for Debian is =www-data=).
			* %T% *HINT:* Run the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. It will show you the user name of the CGI scripts, a table listing all CGI environment variables, and a test of your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file (you'll configure that in a minute).
		* replace user =twiki= with your own username
	* Set the permission of all files below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =-rw-rw-r--= (664) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/data= directory and its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to =chmod= them to =drwxrwxr-x= (775) and to =chown= them to =nobody=.
	* %H% The =twiki/data/*/*.txt,v= RCS repository files in the installation package are locked by user =nobody=. If your CGI scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=, it's not possible to check in files (you'll see that the revision number won't increase after saving a topic). In this case, you need to unlock all repository files (check the RCS man pages) and lock them with a different user, such as =www-data=, or delete them all - new files will be automatically created the first time each topic is edited. A simple way to change ownership is with a search-and-replace in all files; for example, using Perl (type this carefully!):
<blockquote style="background-color:#F5F5F5">
<pre>
cd twiki/data
perl -pi~ -e 'NR <= 10 && s/nobody:/www-data:/ ' */*,v

</pre>
</blockquote>

---+++ Step 3: Set the Main Configuration File

	* Edit the file =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg=, setting the variables to your needs.
		* Set the file extension in the =$scriptSuffix= variable to =cgi= or =pl= if required.
		* RCS - revision control system to store revision of topics and attachments.  You can use RCS executables or a version of RCS written in Perl, note that as the time of writing (Apr 2002) the Perl version has not been widely tested, so if you want to put up a live site the RCS executables are recommended. 
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsWrap";</code> for the RCS executables and make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= to match the location of your RCS binaries. You can check this by issuing the command =rcs= at the prompt, it should result in something like ="rcs: no input file"=.  
				* Check that you have GNU =diff=, by typing =diff -v= - an error indicates you have a non-GNU diff, so install the GNU =diffutils= package and make sure that =diff= is on the PATH used by TWiki (see =$safeEnvPath= in the =TWiki.cfg= file).
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsLite";</code> for the Perl based RCS
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all their subdirectories should be set so that they are __not__ visible through URLs. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= accordingly)
	* Test your settings by running the =testenv= script from your browser: =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/testenv=. Check if your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file settings are correct.


---+++ Step 4: Configure Site-Wide Email Preferences

	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the %TWIKIWEB% web (by pointing your browser to <nop>http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view/%TWIKIWEB%/TWikiPreferences) to set the =WIKIWEBMASTER= email address, and other email settings required for registration and WebChangesAlert to work:
		* =WIKIWEBMASTER= should be set to the email address of the TWiki administrator
		* =SMTPMAILHOST= is typically set on Windows or other non-Unix/Linux systems, where =sendmail= or similar is not available.  When this is set and the Perl module ==Net::SMTP== is installed, TWiki will connect to this SMTP server (e.g. =mail.yourdomain.com=) to send email for user registration and WebChangesAlerts.  If you do have a sendmail-type program, leave =SMTPMAILHOST= unset so that the external sendmail program is used instead (defined by ==$mailProgram== in ==TWiki.cfg==).
		* =SMTPSENDERHOST= is optional, and set to the domain name sending the email (e.g. =twiki.yourdomain.com=). For use where the SMTP server requires that you identify the TWiki server sending mail. If not set, ==Net::SMTP== will guess it for you. 
	* You may want to set up other TWikiPreferences later on.
	* To enable the WebChangesAlerts (email notifications) you need to read about cron in the topic TWiki.TWikiSiteTools.

---+++ Step 5: Finish Up from Your Browser

	* Point your Web browser at =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/bin/view= and start TWiki-ing away!
		* %T% Or, point to =http://yourdomain.com/twiki/= to get the pre-TWiki =index.html= page, with a link to the =view= script. Customize this page if you want a public intro screen with a login link, instead of immediately calling up the .htaccess login dialog by going directly to =view=.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set individual =WEBCOPYRIGHT= messages, and other preferences.
	* Enable email notification of topic changes, TWikiSiteTools has more. 
	* Edit the WebNotify topic in all webs and add the users you want to notify.
	* Add the TWiki:Main/PoweredByTWikiLogo to your [[%MAINWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]] topic.
	* You can add new =%<nop>VARIABLES%=. Define site-level variables in the TWikiPreferences topic. See also: TWikiVariables.

That's it for the standard virgin installation of TWiki. Read on for server-level customization options.

---++ Additional Server-Level Options

With your new TWiki installation up and running, you can manage most aspects of your site from the browser interface. Only a few functions require access to the server file system, via Telnet or FTP. You can make these server-level changes during installation, and at any time afterwards.

#AuthenticationOfUsers
---+++ Enabling Authentication of Users

	* If TWiki is installed on a non-authenticated server - not using SSL - and you'd like to authenticate users:
		1. *Rename* file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. For details, consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://systems.mcs.kent.edu/info/web_help/htaccess/">[2]</a>). In particular, the following <font color="red">red</font> part needs to be configured correctly: <br />
		 =Redirect <font color="red">/urlpathto/twiki/index.html</font> http<nop>://<font color="red">yourdomain.com/urlpathto/twiki/bin/</font>view= <br>
		  =AuthUserFile <font color="red">/filepathto/twiki/data/</font>.htpasswd= <br />
		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpathto/twiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* %X% *NOTE:* If you had to add a =.cgi= or =.pl= file extension to the =bin= scripts, make sure to do the same for =edit=, =view=, =preview=, and all the other script names in =.htaccess=. 
			* %H% The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect, you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory <a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#directory>[3]</a> section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory. 
				* *This applies only if you have root access:* on hosted accounts, you shouldn't have this problem - otherwise, email tech support.
			* %X% *NOTE:* In the TWiki distribution package, the =twiki/data/.htpasswd.txt= file contains several TWiki core team user accounts and a guest user account. You probably want to remove those accounts by deleting the entries in =.htpasswd=. Do not remove the guest user if you want to allow guest logins.
		1. *Copy* the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration, overwriting old version of <nop>TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
	* Customization:
		* You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are carried over into the user home page correctly.
		* You can customize the default user home page in NewUserTemplate.
	* Register yourself in the TWikiRegistration topic.
		* %X% *NOTE:* When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. The =.htpasswd= file that comes with the TWiki installation includes user accounts for TWiki core team members that are used for testing on TWiki.org. You can edit the file and delete those lines.
	* Create a new topic to check if authentication works.
	* Edit the %MAINWEB%.TWikiAdminGroup topic in the TWiki:%MAINWEB% web to include users with system administrator status.
	* Edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the TWiki:%TWIKIWEB% web to set access privileges.
	* Edit the WebPreferences topic in each web, if necessary: set access priviliges.

	* Create custom web-specific templates in a new =twiki/templates/Someweb= directory (otherwise, templates are inherited from =twiki/templates=).
	* Add TWikiForms for form-based page input that's stored separately from the main free-form topic text.

%X% *NOTE:* User home topics are located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web - don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any other web, user signatures have to point to %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web, using a =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= format. (The =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is an advantage if you ever change the %MAINWEB% web name, but the standard =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= is easier for users to enter, which is the bottom line!

#CreateWeb
---+++ Adding a New Web

To create a new web:
	1. *Create* a new web data directory under =twiki/data= and check the file permission of the directory.
		* Use a name consisting of characters =A..Z= , =a..z= but __not__ in WikiNotation.  (The name should start with one (or more) uppercase letters, but have no uppercase letters after the first group -- if it starts with a lowercase letter or is a WikiWord, some features of TWiki will not work as expected.)
	1. *Copy* all files from the =twiki/data/_default= directory to the new data directory, preserving the original files' owner, group and permissions (on Unix, use =cp -p=). The data files must be writable by the owner the CGI scripts are running on (usually, =nobody=). 
		* %T% *HINT:* You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= (666) and then edit the topic using your browser; RCS will restore the file permissions correctly when saving the topic.
	1. *Add* the new web to the web list (visible in the upper right corner of each topic) by editing the site-level preferences, %TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%:
		* Add the new web to the =%<nop>WIKIWEBLIST%= variable.
	1. *Update* the web settings by editing the <nop>WebPreferences topic of the new web:
		* Customize the =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= variable to contain the web-specific links you prefer.
		* Set the WEBBGCOLOR variable to a color. The number represents the unique color for the web.
		* Set Plugins, access privileges, custom variables, other web-level options (ex: =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= can be set for an individual web).
	1. *Test* the new web: view pages, create a new page.

		* RCS - revision control system to store revsion of topics and attachments.  You can use RCS executables or a version of RCS written in Perl, note that as the time of writing (Apr 2002) the Perl version has not been widely tested, so if you want to put up a live site the RCS executables are recommended. (Dateframework - prior version of TWiki only support the RCS executables and do not have the config setting =$storeTopicImpl=)
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsLite";</code> for the Perl based RCS 
			* Set <code>$storeTopicImpl = "RcsWrap";</code> for the RCS execuatbles and make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= to mach the location of your RCS binaries. You can check this by issuing the comand =rcs= at the prompt, it should result in something like ="rcs: no input file"=.
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all its subdirectories should be set so that they are __not__ visible as a URL. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= accordingly)

		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* __NOTE:__ In case you renamed the CGI script files to have a file extension you need to reflect that in the =edit=, =view=, =preview=, etc entries in =.htaccess=.
			* __NOTE:__ The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory.
			* __NOTE:__ The distribution package has a =twiki/data/.htpasswd= file which contains some TWiki core team user accounts and a guest user account. You probably want to remove those accounts by deleting the entries in =.htpasswd=. Do not remove the guest user in case you want to allow guest logins.

d135 1

		* __NOTE:__ When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file.

		  =Redirect <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/index.html</font> http<nop>://<font color="red">your.domain.com/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>view= <br>
		  =AuthUserFile <font color="red">/filepath/to/TWiki/data/</font>.htpasswd= <br>
		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* __NOTE:__ In case you renamed the CGI script files to have a file extension you need to reflect that in the =edit=, =view=, =preview=, etc entries in =.htaccess=.
			* __NOTE:__ The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory.
		1. *Copy* the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
			* You can customize the registration form by deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This ensures that the fields are processed correctly.

		* __NOTE:__ When a user registers, a new line with the username and encrypted password is added to the =data/.htpasswd= file. The =.htpasswd= file that comes with the TWiki installation includes user accounts for TWiki core team members that are used for testing on TWiki.org. You can edit the file and delete those lines.

	* Restart Apache by =/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S85httpd restart= .
	* Test if the =twiki/bin= directory is CGI-enabled:
		* Enter the URL of that directory into your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin= ). It is not set correctly as cgi-bin in case you get something like ="Index of /twiki/bin"= . It is OK if you get a message like ="Forbidden. You don't have permission to access /twiki/bin/ on this server."=
		* Execute the =testenv= script from your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/testenv= ). It shows a table with all CGI environment variables. It also tests the settings in your =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= configuration file, which you will set later on.

---+++ Step 3: Enable Perl File Permissions

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. The default location of Perl is =/usr/bin/perl=. If Perl is installed elsewhere, change the first line of all scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory (or create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl=).
		* *IMPORTANT:* On most ISP virtual domain accounts, Perl CGI scripts require a =.cgi= extension to run. Some systems need =.pl=, the regular Perl extension. Change all =twiki/bin= scripts appropriately if necessary.

In case the user is different (ex: =www-data= ), it is not possible to check in files, this has the effect that the topic version number does not increase when saving a topic. In this case you need to unlock all repository files and lock them as user =www-data= (check the rcs man pages), or simply delete all the repository files. A simple way to switch the locker of the RCS files is to use sed: <br> =for f in *,v; do sed 's/nobody\:/www-data\:/' $f &gt; x; mv x $f; done=

	* __NOTE:__ This Installation Guide assumes the following:

		* *User =nobody= <nop>* is used for all files manipulated by the CGI scripts (executed by the Web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. Replace user =nobody= with another user if your Web server executes scripts under a different name (default for Debian is =www-data=). Also, you can substitute user =twiki= with your own username.

		* *You have control* over the Web server configuration files. In case you don't - you may be installing on an ISP-hosted server - follow the steps but use these directories instead: 

| *TWiki dir:* | *What it is:* | *Where to copy:* | *Example:* |
| =twiki/bin= | CGI bin | cgi-bin enabled dir | =/home/smith/public_html/cgi-bin= |

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library are installed on your system. Default location of Perl executable is =/usr/bin/perl=. In case Perl is installed in a different location, the first line of all Perl scripts in the ==twiki/bin== directory must be changed (alternatively you can create a symbolic link from ==/usr/bin/perl== ).
		* *IMPORTANT:* On most ISP virtual domain accounts, Perl CGI scripts require a ==.cgi== extension to run. Some systems need ==.pl==, the regular Perl extension. Change all ==twiki/bin== scripts appropriately if necessary.
	* To be able to edit the Perl scripts and ==.tmpl== files it is necessary to ==chown== and ==chgrp -R twiki== so all the files have the owner you want.
	* The CGI scripts execute as ==nobody==. Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the ==twiki/bin== directory as executable to ==-rwxr-xr-x== (755).
	* Set the permission of all files below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to ==chmod== them to ==-rw-rw-r--== (664) and to ==chown== them to ==nobody==.
	* Set the permission of the ==twiki/data== directory and its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user ==nobody==. A simple way is to chmod them to ==drwxrwxr-x== (775) and to ==chown== them to ==nobody==.
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to ==chmod== them to ==drwxrwxr-x== (775) and to ==chown== them to ==nobody==.

In this case you need to unlock all repository files and lock them as user =www-data= (check the rcs man pages), or simply delete all the repository files. A simple way to switch the locker of the RCS files is to use sed: <br> =for f in *,v; do sed 's/nobody\:/www-data\:/' $f &gt; x; mv x $f; done=
	* *Security issue:* Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all its subdirectories should be set so that they are *not* visible as a URL. (Alternatively, move the directories to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/lib/TWiki.cfg= accordingly)

---+++ Creating a New Web

	* To create a new web:
		1. *Create* a new web data directory under =twiki/data= and check the file permission of the directory.
			* Use a name consisting of characters =A..Z= , =a..z= but __not__ in WikiNotation.
		1. *Copy* all files from the =twiki/data/_default= directory to the new data directory, preserving the original files' owner, group and permissions (on Unix, use =cp -p=). The data files must be writable by the owner the CGI scripts are running on (usually, =nobody=). 
			* __Hint:__ You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= (666) and then edit the topic using your browser; RCS will restore the file permissions correctly when saving the topic.
		1. *Add* the new web to the web list (visible in the upper right corner of each topic) by editing the site-level preferences, %TWIKIWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%:
			* Add the new web to the =%<nop>WIKIWEBLIST%= variable.
		1. *Update* the web settings by editing the <nop>WebPreferences topic of the new web:
			* Customize the =%<nop>WEBTOPICLIST%= variable to contain the web-specific links you prefer.
			* Set the WEBBGCOLOR variable to a color. The number represents the unique color for the web.
			* Set Plugins, access privileges, custom variables, other web-level options (ex: =%<nop>WEBCOPYRIGHT%= can be set for an individual web).
		1. *Add* the new web to the color-coded web directory table by editing the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiWebsTable topic.
		1. *Test* the new web: view pages, create a new page.

	* That's it for a basic new web set-up. You can also further customize the web:
		* Create customized templates in the new templates directory (otherwise, templates are inherited from =twiki/templates=).
			* __NOTE:__ For web-specific templates in a =templates= subdirectory, ex: =twiki/templates/someweb=.
		* Create TWikiForms to add form-based page input that's stored separately from the main free-form topic text.

	* __NOTE:__ User home topics are located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web - don't try to move them or create them in other webs. From any web you can refer to users located in the %WIKITOOLNAME%.%MAINWEB% web with =%MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= or =%<nop>MAINWEB%.<nop>UserName= - using the =%<nop>MAINWEB%= variable is preferable, particularly if you might change the %MAINWEB% web name.

---+++ Adding Variables &amp; Rendering Rules 
d134 1
a134 2
	* You can add new =%<nop>VARIABLES%=. Define site-level variables in the TWikiPreferences topic. See also TWikiVariables.
	* You can add new rendering rules or add new functionality to TWiki. To insure an easy upgrade of TWiki, it is recommended to do this sort of customization with TWikiPlugins and the Plugins API.

	* If you are on a non-authenticated server - not using SSL - and you would like to authenticate users:
d146 1

			* __NOTE:__ You can customize the registration form if needed, like deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This will ensure that the fields are processed correctly.
d148 1
a148 1
		* A new line containing user name and encrypted password gets added to the =data/.htpasswd= file when a users registers. The file that comes with the TWiki installation contains a few user accounts of TWiki core team members (needed for testing). You can edit the file and delete those lines.

__Note:__ Below installation steps assume user =nobody= for all files manupulated by the cgi scripts (executed by the web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. You need to replace user =nobody= with an other user in case the web server executes the script with a different user ( default for Debian is =www-data= ). Also, you can substitute user =twiki= with your own user name.

These installation steps use the Apache web server on Linux as an example. TWiki should run on other web servers and Unix systems as well. (TWiki on Windows is possible, but has not been documented well. More on that at http://TWiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/TWikiOnWindows )

	* Make sure Perl 5 and the Perl CGI library is installed on your system. Default location of Perl executable is =/usr/bin/perl= . In case Perl is installed in a different location, the first line of all perl scripts in the ==twiki/bin== directory need to be changed (alternatively you can create a symbolic link from ==/usr/bin/perl== ).

__Note:__ Below installation steps assume that you have control over the web server configuraton files. In case you don't (i.e. if you are installing it on a hosted server) follow the steps but use these directories instead:

a24 1
---+++ Standard Installation Steps
a25 1
	* Request the TWiki distribution (in Unix ZIP format) from http://TWiki.org/download.html .
d31 3
a33 1
	* Here are example =httpd.conf= entries:
d46 4
d53 17
a69 15
		* Execute the =testenv= script from your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/testenv= ). It shows a table with all CGI environment variables and tests the settings in your =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= configuration file.
	* Make sure PERL 5 and the PERL CGI library is installed on your system. Default location of PERL executable is =/usr/bin/perl= . In case PERL is installed in a different location, the first line of all perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory need to be changed (alternatively you can create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl= ).
	* To be able to edit the perl scripts and .tmpl files it is necessary to =chown= and =chgrp -R twiki= so all the files have the owner you want.
	* The scripts execute as =nobody= . Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory as executable to =-rwxr-xr-x= .
	* Set the permission of all files below =twiki/data= so that they are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to 666 ( =-rw-rw-rw-= ).
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/data= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to 777 ( =drwxrwxrwx= ).
	* Set the permission of the =twiki/pub= directory and all its subdirectories so that files in there are writable by user =nobody=. A simple way is to chmod them to 777 ( =drwxrwxrwx= ).
	* Edit the file =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= and set the variables at the beginning of the file to your needs.
	* Make sure RCS is installed. Set =$rcsDir= in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= to mach the location of your RCS binaries.
	* Point your browser at http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/view and start TWiki-ing away!
	* Using your browser, edit the TWikiPreferences topic in the TWiki.%TWIKIWEB% web to set the WIKIWEBMASTER email address, the WEBCOPYRIGHT message and other preferences.
	* Note in case the cgi scripts must have a file extension like =.pl= or =.cgi=:
		* Add the extension to all the scripts (except for the =.pm= ones) in =twiki/bin=
		* Edit =wikicfg.pm= and set the file extension in the =$scriptSuffix= variable.
		* If you use =.htaccess=, edit the file and add the file extension to =edit=, =view=, =preview=, etc.
d71 2
a72 2
	* Security issue: Directories =twiki/data= , =twiki/templates= and all its subdirectories should be set so that they are *not* visible as a URL. (Alternatively, move the directries to a place where they are not visible, and change the variables in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= accordingly)
	* Enable email notification of topic changes, [[TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Notification_of_Changes][Notification of Changes]] has more. Using your browser, edit also the WebNotify topic in all webs and set the users you want to notify.
d75 1
a75 15
---+++ Adding Variables &amp; Rendering Rules 

	* Optional: You can add new rendering rules or new %<nop>VARIABLES%. To insure an easy upgrade of TWiki it is recommended to do this customization in =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= , not =twiki/bin/wiki.pm= .

---+++ Enabling Basic Authentication (.htaccess)

	* Optional: If you are on a non authenticated server (i.e. not using SSL) and you would like to authenticate users:
		* Rename file =.htaccess.txt= in the =twiki/bin= directory to =.htaccess= and change it to your needs. For details consult the HTTP server documentation (for Apache server: <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/directives.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.mcs.kent.edu/system/web_help/htaccess/introduction.html">[2]</a>). In particular, the following <font color="red">red</font> part needs to be configured correctly: <br>
		  =Redirect <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/index.html</font> http<nop>://<font color="red">your.domain.com/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>view= <br>
		  =AuthUserFile <font color="red">/filepath/to/TWiki/data/</font>.htpasswd= <br>
		  =ErrorDocument 401 <font color="red">/urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/</font>oops/TWiki/TWikiRegistration?template=oopsauth=
			* __Note:__ The browser should ask for login name and password when you click on the <u>Edit</u> link. In case =.htaccess= does not have the desired effect you need to enable it: Add "AllowOverride All" to the Directory section of =access.conf= for your =twiki/bin= directory.
		* Copy the TWikiRegistrationPub topic to TWikiRegistration. Do that by either editing the topics in the%TWIKIWEB% web, or by renaming the =.txt= and =.txt,v= files in the =twiki/data/%TWIKIWEB%= directory.
			* __Note:__ You can customize the registration form if needed, like deleting or adding input tags. The =name=""= parameter of the input tags must start with: ="Twk0..."= (if this is an optional entry), or ="Twk1..."= (if this is a required entry). This will ensure that the fields are processed correctly.
		* A new line containing user name and encrypted password gets added to the =data/.htpasswd= file when a users registers. The file that comes with the TWiki installation contains a few user accounts of TWiki core team members (needed for testing). You can edit the file and delete those lines.
d77 8
a84 1
---+++ Generating Site Usage Statistics
d86 1
a86 10
	* Optional: You can automatically generate usage statistics for all webs. To enable this:
		* Make sure variable =$doLogTopicView, $doLogTopicSave and $doLogTopicUpload= in =wikicfg.pm= are set. This will generate log entries in file =twiki/data/log&lt;date&gt;.txt= .
		* Topic WebStatistics must be present in all webs where you want to have statistics. You can use the topic in the Main web as a template.
		* Call the =twiki/bin/statistics= script from a cron job, once a day is recommended. This will update the WebStatistics topics in all webs.
		* __Attention:__ The script must run as the same user as the CGI scripts are running, which is user =nobody= on most systems. Example crontab entry: <br> =0 0 * * * (cd /path/to/TWiki/bin; ./statistics &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1)=
		* There is a workaround in case you can't run the script as user =nobody= : Run the utility =twiki/bin/geturl= in your cron job and specify the URL of the =twiki/bin/statistics= script as a parameter. Example: <br> =0 0 * * * (cd /path/to/TWiki/bin; ./geturl mydomain.com /urlpath/to/TWiki/bin/statistics &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1)=
		* The =twiki/bin/statistics= script can also be executed as a CGI script, just enter the URL in your browser. Examples:
			* Update current month for all webs: <br> =http://mydomain.com/twiki/bin/statistics=
			* Update current month for Main web only: <br> =http://mydomain.com/twiki/bin/statistics/Main=
			* Update January 2000 for Main web: <br> =http://mydomain.com/twiki/bin/statistics/Main?logdate=200001=

	* Note in case the cgi scripts are __not__ running as user =nobody=: The =*,v= RCS repository files delivered with the installation package are locked by user =nobody= . In case the user is different (e.g. =www-data= ), it is not possible to check in files, this has the effect that the topic version number does not increase when saving a topic. In this case you need to unlock all repository files and lock them as user =www-data= (check the rcs man pages), or simply delete all the repository files. A simple way to switch the locker of the RCS files is to use sed: <br> =for f in *,v; do sed 's/nobody/www-data/' $f &gt; x; mv x $f; done=

__Note:__ These installation notes assume user =nobody= for all files manupulated by the cgi scripts (executed by the web server), and user =twiki= for all other files. You need to replace user =nobody= with an other user in case the web server executes the script with a different user ( default for Debian is =www-data= ). Also, you can substitute user =twiki= with your own user name.

		* Execute the =testenv= script from your browser ( =http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/testenv= ). It should show a table of all CGI environment variables.
	* Make sure PERL and the PERL CGI library is installed on your system. Default location of PERL executable is =/usr/bin/perl= . In case PERL is installed in a different location, the first line of all perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory need to be changed (alternatively you can create a symbolic link from =/usr/bin/perl= ).

	* The scripts execute as =nobody= . Set the file permission of all Perl scripts in the =twiki/bin= directory as executable to =-rw-r-xr-x= .

	* Make sure RCS is installed. In case RCS is not in the =path= environment variable, add it to =path= . Alternatively, add the full path name to the =rcs, ci, co, rlog, rcsdiff= commands in the variables of =twiki/bin/wikicfg.pm= .
	* Point your browser at http://your.domain.com/twiki/bin/view and start wiki-ing away!

		* Copy the files =WebHome.txt= , =WebPreferences.txt= , =WebNotify.txt= , =WebSearch.txt= and =WebStatistics.txt= from the =twiki/data/Main= directory to the new data directory, preserving the original files' owner, group and permissions ( on Unix use =cp -p= ). The data files must be writable by the owner the CGI scripts are running on ( usually =nobody= ). Hint: You can set permissions of =.txt= and =.txt,v= files to =-rw-rw-rw-= and then edit the topic using your browser, RCS will restore the file permission correctly when saving the topic.
		* Add the new web to the web list (on top of each topic) by editing the site-level preferences %MAINWEB%.%WIKIPREFSTOPIC%:

	* The =twiki/bin= directory of TWiki must be set as a cgi-bin directory. Add =/home/httpd/twiki/bin= to file =/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf= with only =ExecCGI= option.
	* The =twiki/pub= directory of TWiki must be set so that it is visible as a URL. Add =/home/httpd/twiki= to file =http.conf= with normal access options (copy from =/home/httpd/html= ).
	* Now add =ScriptAlias= for =/twiki/bin= and =Alias= for =/twiki= to file =http.conf= .
	  <br> __Note:__ The =ScriptAlias=  *must* come before the =Alias= in Apache, otherwise it will fail to correctly set up =/twiki/bin/= , due to the fact that it sees that as being just another subdirectory of the =/twiki/= alias.
	* Here are example =http.conf= entries:
