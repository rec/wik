---+ Jump Box

_The Jump Box at the top or sidebar of each page is a hidden gem for quick navigation in a large TWiki._

1. *Quick Jump:* Enter a topic name to quickly jump to the topic, for example:

   * =WebNotify= to jump to <nop>WebNotify in the current web
   * =%USERSWEB%.WebNotify= to jump to <nop>WebNotify in the %USERSWEB% web
   * =%USERSWEB%.= to jump to the home of the %USERSWEB% web
   * =BrandNewTopic= to jump to a non existing topic in the current web, which is useful to create orphaned topics

2. *Quick Navigation:* Enter part of a topic name to get a list of similar topics, for example:

   * =faq= to get %SEARCH{ "faq" scope="topic" nosearch="on" nototal="on" format="[[$topic]]" separator=", " }%
   * =%USERSWEB%.users=  to jump to the %USERSWEB% web from any web, and get a list of topics about users (all in one step)

__%T% Tip:__ Entering part of a topic name is a simple, yet powerful way to quickly navigate to content of interest, also in a large wiki.

__Note:__ The Jump Box is not a search box
