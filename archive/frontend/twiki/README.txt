TWiki (R) - the Open Source Enterprise Wiki and Web Application Platform
========================================================================

What is TWiki?
--------------

Welcome to TWiki, a powerful, and easy to use enterprise wiki, 
enterprise collaboration platform, and web application platform. 
It is a Structured Wiki, typically used to run a project 
development space, a document management system, a knowledge 
base, or any other groupware tool, on an intranet, extranet or 
the Internet. Users without programming skills can create web 
applications. Developers can extend the functionality of TWiki 
with plugins. TWiki fosters information flow within an 
organization, lets distributed teams work together seamlessly 
and productively, and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of 
outdated intranet content. TWiki has been downloaded over 
500,000 times and is used daily by millions of people in over 
100 countries. Some larger deployments have several 100,000 
pages and over 10,000 users. TWiki is developed by an active 
open source community on http://twiki.org.

Major companies such as Amazon.com, AMD, British Telecom, IBM, 
Oracle, Motorola, SAP and many others depend on the TWiki 
platform to increase the productivity of their teams. 

The GPLed TWiki software and over hundreds of Plugins can be 
downloaded from the TWiki.org web site, http://TWiki.org/.
